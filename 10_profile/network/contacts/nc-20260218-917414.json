    "outreach_angle": "Denis just launched AX, an AI-powered accelerator for creative tech. Overture (live music community platform) fits squarely in the creative tech category. Reach out referencing the AX launch and asking whether Overture could be a fit for the program. Even if not a direct AX fit, Denis as a GP in creative tech is a natural investor conversation for Overture. Additionally, Fuelarts' interest in AI-mediated tools makes ATX relevant as a B2B SaaS product for accelerators managing portfolio relationships.",
