For Mirari/AURA (spatial computing, AR overlay on Zurich), the space/positioning technology angle could qualify for ESA BIC consideration. More immediately, Thomas's network across ETH startups gives him visibility into enterprise clients (municipalities, infrastructure) relevant for Kavach AI and Bramha ESG. Reach out: 'Thomas — following up from our connection. I have been building Mirari, a spatial AR companion for Zürich. Given ETH's work in spatial computing, I would love 20 minutes to share what we are doing and get your perspective on whether there is an ESA BIC angle or relevant ETH research connections.' Timeline: this month.",
