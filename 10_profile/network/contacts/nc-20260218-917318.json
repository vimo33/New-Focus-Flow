Reach out with an update and ask for one specific introduction: 'Ajith — checking in after our August chat. I have been heads-down building Multiplium and Kavach AI. Would love a quick catch-up. Also — do you know anyone in the security or AI infrastructure space in India or Singapore who might find Kavach interesting? Happy to make introductions in return.' Low effort, high potential return on referrals.",
