    "outreach_angle": "Kevin is a growth advisor for deep tech ventures — exactly what Vimo's portfolio needs. He could serve as advisor for Kavach AI (deep tech, edge AI) or Multiplium (AI infrastructure). The conversation has two angles: (1) exploring whether he would advise on a project on a light advisory arrangement; (2) whether his current portfolio of advised companies includes potential clients for Bramha ESG or Kavach AI. Reach out this week: 'Kevin — checking back in after our April conversation. I have been heads-down on two projects — Kavach AI and Multiplium. Would love 20 minutes to share updates and explore whether there is an advisory fit. Are you available for a quick call?'",
