    "outreach_angle": "Penny is building AI infrastructure for VC deal sourcing — a direct strategic overlap with ATX (Agentic Trust Exchange) which mediates professional collaboration via AI agents. Reach out noting that ATX's agent-based compatibility evaluation could extend Raized.ai's deal matching layer. Also, Nitara (Focus Flow OS) as a SaaS product for founders could be relevant to Raized.ai's portfolio company support toolkit. Given the Venturelab connection, this could also open introduction to Swiss VC pipeline.",
