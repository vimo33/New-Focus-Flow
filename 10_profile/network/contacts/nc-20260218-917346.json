    "outreach_angle": "Nathalie was contacted 12 months ago — the relationship needs a check-in. Venturelab is the central institution for Swiss startup support and has direct access to the VC funds deploying capital in 2026. This is the single most strategic institutional relationship for getting Vimo's projects in front of Swiss VC. Reach out with a specific project update: 'Nathalie — it has been a year since we last spoke. I have advanced significantly on two projects — Bramha ESG (AI-native ESG compliance for Swiss SMEs) and Mirari (a Zürich AR travel companion). I would love to share progress and explore whether there is a Venturelab program fit for either. Are you available for a 20-minute call in March?' Timeline: this week.",
