Bramha ESG's AI-native compliance platform needs to integrate ecoinvent's LCI database for credible scope 3 emissions reporting. Two angles: (1) a data licensing partnership where Bramha ESG uses ecoinvent data as a premium add-on; (2) ecoinvent as a distribution partner — they sell to ESG teams who need compliance tools. Reach out: 'Armin — I am building Bramha ESG, an AI-native ESG compliance platform for Swiss SMEs. We are exploring integrating ecoinvent's LCI data as the emissions factor backbone. I would love 20 minutes to discuss a data partnership. Are you open to a call?' Timeline: this month.",
