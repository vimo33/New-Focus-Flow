    "outreach_angle": "Climate Week Zurich runs 4-9 May 2026 — that is 10 weeks away. Johannes is organizing this event. Two revenue angles: (1) Bramha ESG could sponsor or present at Climate Week Zurich as a launch platform to Swiss SME decision-makers who attend; (2) Johannes needs event tech — the Global Foundation for Transparent Collective Gatherings governance tools could be piloted at Climate Week Zurich as a transparent governance layer for the event. Contact this week to discuss either angle — the sponsorship conversation has a natural 8-week lead time.",
