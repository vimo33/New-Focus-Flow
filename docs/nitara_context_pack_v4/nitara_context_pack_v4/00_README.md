# Nitara Context Pack v4 — UI/UX + Interaction Plan (Old UI baseline)

Generated: 2026-02-21

This pack assumes:
- We continue with the **older UI design language** as the baseline (dark glass + cyan/teal accent).
- Bottom navigation is already implemented; we continue building on it.
- We upgrade UX on existing screens (Council Verdict + Project Details first).
- Network and other modules have basic implementations; we align them to the reference designs.

Included:
- `design/current_screens/` — screenshots from current system (29)
- `design/old_ui_reference/` — old design reference screens + DS library
- `docs/` — per-screen interactions + UX upgrades + implementation priorities
