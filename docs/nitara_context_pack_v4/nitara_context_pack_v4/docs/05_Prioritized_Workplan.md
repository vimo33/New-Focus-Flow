# Prioritized Workplan (what Claude should build next)

## Sprint 1 — UI/UX fixes + leverage the existing backend
1) Council Verdict screen UX refactor:
   - 3-line clamp summary + expand/drawer
   - recommended actions checklist → create tasks
   - ensure council content stays above fold
2) Project Details screen UX refactor:
   - overview clamp + sticky action blocks
   - consistent evidence drawer
3) Network screen upgrade:
   - align to old Network View reference (graph + list + draft outreach)
4) Command palette polish:
   - match old global portal design; keyboard-first interactions
5) DS extraction:
   - create tokens.json and UI kit route for primitives

## Sprint 2 — Voice + approvals in the old UI language
- Voice console page uses voice state patterns + approvals stream

## Sprint 3 — Validate spine loop
- experiment → decision gate → build kickoff

Deliverable: Nitara feels coherent, usable daily, and visually consistent.
