# Claude Task: Network Screen Upgrade (Old UI alignment)

Goal: Replace basic network tab with old design behavior.

Implement:
- Left list with search + tags
- Graph canvas placeholder (or existing component)
- Clicking a node opens person detail panel
- Draft outreach button creates a draft message and queues approval

Acceptance:
- Usable without graph (fallback list-only)
- Works with 312 contacts scale (virtual list)
