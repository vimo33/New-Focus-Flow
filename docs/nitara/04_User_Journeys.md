# Key User Journeys

## J1 — New venture creation (Idea → Project)
1. Capture idea (voice/text/upload) → normalized into an “Idea” object
2. Nitara asks 3–7 clarifying questions to define *success* + constraints
3. Nitara generates:
   - problem framing
   - ICP / customer hypothesis
   - differentiation hypothesis
   - first experiments (fastest learning per unit time)
4. You approve a plan → Idea becomes a Project with an initial “Experiment Stack”

## J2 — Portfolio prioritization (weekly)
1. Nitara produces a weekly portfolio analysis
2. You review top recommendations:
   - Build-next
   - Invest / allocate more resources
   - Pivot
   - Park
   - Kill
3. You approve a reallocation plan (time/compute/budget)

## J3 — Validate loop (Experiment Stack)
1. Select project → see active experiments
2. Launch / run experiment (manual or assisted or auto)
3. Measure outcomes + confidence
4. Decision gate:
   - Scale
   - Another variant
   - Pivot
   - Park
   - Kill

## J4 — Build loop (MVP execution)
1. Nitara converts validated learnings into a build spec
2. Claude Code executes build tasks (scaffold, implement, test)
3. HITL checkpoints:
   - data deletion
   - spending increases
   - external communications
4. Deploy → monitor → feed results back into Validate

## J5 — Rationalization (Kill / Park / Pivot)
1. Nitara flags stagnation or opportunity cost
2. You review evidence + salvage plan
3. If killing:
   - archive assets
   - write “postmortem + playbooks”
   - release resources back to portfolio
