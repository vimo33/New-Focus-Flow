# UI Flows (v1)

Nitara is a Founder OS with five operational modes (dock):
- Think → portfolio strategy, venture stack, hypotheses
- Validate → experiments, evidence, decision gates
- Build → agents execute, logs, approvals
- Grow → resource allocation, simulation, runway
- Leverage → templates, automation, distribution (later)

Below are the core user journeys we build first.

## Flow A — Start of day (Cognition → Think)
1. Open Cognition: see load, energy, recommended actions.
2. Approve delegation if load is high.
3. Jump to Think: review portfolio health + venture stack.
4. Choose next highest leverage venture (or accept Nitara recommendation).

## Flow B — Make a decision (Validate)
1. Open Validate / Experiment Stack.
2. Pick any experiment flagged Decision Required.
3. Review evidence + volatility + confidence.
4. Choose: Scale / Another Variant / Kill.
5. If Kill → typed confirmation + auto learning capture.

## Flow C — Execute (Build)
1. Open Build / Autonomous Intelligence Builder.
2. See recommended Highest ROI action.
3. Click Execute → goes to Approvals (early phase: always approve).
4. Execution runs, artefacts produced (report, code PR, email draft).
5. Logs + cost updated.

## Flow D — Rebalance resources (Grow)
1. Open Grow / Resource & Simulation Engine.
2. Adjust variables (cash/time/attention/compute).
3. Run simulation, compare scenarios.
4. Apply reallocation → approvals + audit.

## Flow E — Sunset a project (Project Control)
1. Open project detail → status shows stagnation / below threshold.
2. Enter Rationalization Protocol.
3. Review why-now data, opportunity cost, resource unlock.
4. Choose Pivot or Kill:
   - Pivot: reroute core IP; preserve repo + assets.
   - Kill: typed confirmation; start salvage ritual; archive + export; release compute.

## Flow F — Explainability (Inference Logic)
Anywhere a metric is shown (cognitive load, confidence, volatility), user can open:
- Inference Logic panel → factor breakdown, weighting, trend, calibration action.

See 18_Screens_To_Design.md for the remaining flows and screen backlog.
