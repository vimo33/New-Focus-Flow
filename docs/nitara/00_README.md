# Nitara Context Pack (Draft v0)

Generated: 2026-02-19

This ZIP is a **context + implementation blueprint** you can drop into your repo to help Claude Code (and Pencil) implement Nitara in a consistent way.

It contains:
- Vision + product principles
- Information architecture, user journeys, and UI flow maps
- Screen inventory (what to design/build)
- Data model + memory architecture (file + vector + summaries)
- Autonomy/HITL safety model
- A phased implementation roadmap (what to implement first)
- Claude Code briefing + Pencil workflow
- Open questions to answer to lock v1 scope

> Note: This is a **Draft v0** based on the current thread + the existing Focus Flow UI routes we can see in the repo. Update the open questions and rerun the plan once those are answered.
