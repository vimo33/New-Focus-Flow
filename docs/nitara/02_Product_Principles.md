# Product Principles

1. **Decision-first UI**
   - Every screen should end in: “What decision are we making?” and “What action is next?”

2. **General-purpose, project-specific**
   - UI is consistent; expertise comes from per-project agent teams + playbooks.

3. **Autonomy with dignity**
   - Clear autonomy levels (Manual → Assisted → Auto) per project and per action type.

4. **Truth over vibes**
   - All recommendations must show:
     - evidence sources
     - assumptions
     - confidence calibration
     - counterarguments / failure modes

5. **Memory is the product**
   - Everything becomes a structured artifact: hypothesis, experiment, result, decision, playbook.

6. **Safety by design**
   - Tool gating, budgets, circuit breakers, and irreversible actions require explicit confirmation.
