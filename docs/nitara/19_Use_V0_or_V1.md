# V0 vs V1 — what to use with Claude Code

Use v1 unless you are in a hurry to start coding today.

Why v1 is better
- Latest screen summary plus explicit backlog.
- Includes the attached Stitch export bundle (visual reference).
- Adds a clean design-system contract plus Stitch prompt so Claude and Pencil do not drift.

When v0 is okay
- You only want to wire routes and mock data and will redo UI later.
- You have not run Stitch yet and do not want to lock tokens.

Recommendation: start Claude with v1 to minimize rework and context drift.
