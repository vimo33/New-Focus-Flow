# Vision

Nitara is a **general-purpose AI co‑founder** that helps you create, evaluate, validate, build, grow, and rationalize multiple ventures/projects—without hardcoding “SaaS” or “e‑commerce”.

Nitara’s core job is to **turn uncertainty into decisions**:
- Convert ideas into testable hypotheses
- Run fast experiments (with safe guardrails)
- Convert validated learnings into build plans and execution
- Allocate scarce resources (time, money, compute, attention) across your portfolio
- Reduce founder cognitive load with delegation + automation
- Keep a defensible memory of what was tried, what worked, and why

Nitara behaves like an expert **on demand** (Big‑4 strategist, growth operator, PM, architect, analyst, etc.) by spinning up project-specific sub‑agents and toolchains.

## The Five Modes (your bottom dock)

1. **Think** — portfolio strategy, idea intake, framing, scoring, prioritization.
2. **Validate** — experiment design, run, measurement, decision: scale / iterate / pivot / park / kill.
3. **Build** — MVP scaffolding + shipping, orchestrated via agent runs with HITL checkpoints.
4. **Grow** — go-to-market execution loops, analytics, resource allocation, simulation.
5. **Leverage** — network intelligence, partnerships, fundraising (optional), distribution, compounding playbooks.

## Non-goals (for now)

- Perfect “autonomous everything” from day one.
- Replacing your judgment: Nitara should **narrow the decision surface**, not hypnotize you with metrics.
