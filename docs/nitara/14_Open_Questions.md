# Open Questions (Answer these to lock v1)

1. **Scope of users:** Is Nitara “you-only” for now, or must it support multi-user/team accounts from day one?
2. **Primary platform:** Desktop web only, or must mobile be first-class?
3. **Data sources:** What is the “source of truth” for tasks/projects today (Obsidian vault? existing Focus Flow JSON? something else)?
4. **Autonomy policy:** Which actions are allowed to run automatically without approval (Tier 1) for you?
5. **External actions:** Should Nitara be able to send emails/DMs autonomously, or always require approval?
6. **Budgets:** Do you want the UI to manage daily/weekly budgets (editing cost-budget.json), or keep that server-side only?
7. **Project stages:** What are your canonical stages? (Idea, Validation, MVP, Growth, Monetization, Exit…)
8. **Metrics:** What are your default metrics per category (SaaS vs ecomm vs services)? Or do you want a “metric template picker”?
9. **Memory privacy:** Which profile/network data is restricted vs always available to agents?
10. **First real journey:** Which single journey should we implement first end-to-end?
    (Recommended: New venture → 1 experiment → decision gate → builder kickoff.)

Once these are answered, we can produce a v1 pack with exact acceptance criteria and tasks.
