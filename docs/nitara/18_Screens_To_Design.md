# Screen backlog (what we still need to design)

This is the full set of screens we will eventually have, grouped by mode.
Rule: every screen must map to a job-to-be-done and a data contract.

## Global / System
- Auth / First Run (workspace, integrations, storage mode)
- Approvals Queue
- Notifications Center
- Settings (profile, workspace, privacy, keys)
- Activity / Audit Log

## Think Mode (Portfolio & Strategy)
- Portfolio Strategy (baseline exists)
- Venture detail (overview, hypotheses, signals, roadmap, runway)
- New Venture wizard (idea → hypothesis → experiment plan)
- Opportunity Radar
- Playbook library

## Validate Mode (Experiments / Crucible)
- Experiment Stack overview (baseline exists)
- Experiment detail (evidence, cohorts, stats, decision gate)
- Variant testing builder
- Data sources mapping (events schema, pipelines, quality checks)
- Post-mortem / Learning capture

## Build Mode (Autonomous Builder / Agents)
- Autonomous Builder feed (baseline exists)
- Agent management (permissions, budgets, tool access)
- Task composer (inputs, guardrails, expected output)
- Execution details (logs, artefacts, retries, cost breakdown)
- Pencil UI generation console (generate screen → review diff → merge)

## Grow Mode (Resources / Simulation)
- Resource & Simulation Engine (baseline exists)
- Simulation detail (assumptions, sensitivity, scenario compare)
- Resource allocator (people/agents/compute/cash/attention)
- Runway planner
- Budgeting & spend controls

## Project Control / Sunset
- Rationalization Protocol (baseline exists)
- Project control hub (risk, milestones, deprecation timeline)
- Knowledge harvest (assets, playbooks, exports)
- Offboarding flows (export + compliance checklist)

## Cognition (Meta-Intelligence)
- Founder cognitive intelligence (baseline exists)
- Cognition history / trends
- Bio-sync integration
- Decision review

## Leverage Mode (later)
- automation templates
- reusable agent stacks
- distribution channels
- CRM pipelines
