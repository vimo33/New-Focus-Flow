# Information Architecture

## Core objects
- **Founder** (profile, constraints, preferences)
- **Portfolio** (set of ventures/projects)
- **Venture / Project**
- **Idea** (pre-project)
- **Hypothesis** (belief to test)
- **Experiment** (a test with a metric + decision rule)
- **Signal** (metric datapoint, user feedback, market info, network info)
- **Decision** (scale/iterate/pivot/park/kill + rationale)
- **Agent Run** (orchestrated execution with logs)
- **Playbook** (reusable tactic extracted from results)
- **Tool** (MCP/tool registry entry)

## Navigation model
- Global: a “Mission Control” layer (search/command bar + status + notifications)
- Primary: bottom dock with **Think / Validate / Build / Grow / Leverage**
- Secondary: within a mode, you see “cards” representing:
  - portfolio view, project view, experiment view, run view, etc.
