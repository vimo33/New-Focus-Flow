          "reasoning": "AURA v5.0 is technically ambitious to the point of self-contradiction on several fronts. Web search was unavailable, so this assessment draws on existing knowledge of the named model families and mobile AI state-of-art as of mid-2025, projected to 2026.\n\nThe named stack is a mix of real research lineages (MiniCPM-o exists up to 2.6, Qwen-VL is a real Alibaba family, BitNet b1.58 is real Microsoft Research work) and fabricated/aspirational version numbers. MiniCPM-o '4.5', Qwen3-VL Nano with centimeter 3D grounding, 'MobileLLM-Pro P1', and 'NeuTTS-Nano' do not exist as shipping products. The PRD is writing 2026 model names as if they are known quantities, which they are not.\n\nThe most critical incoherence: 'AURA proactively identifies landmarks before user raises phone.' On a smartphone, the camera is occluded when the phone is pocketed. This is physically impossible unless the device is AR glasses or a wearable with an always-on camera \u2014 neither of which is specified. This is a design assumption that breaks the entire 'Zero-UI' premise on the primary form factor (phone).\n\nCentimeter-precision 3D spatial grounding from a monocular RGB camera is beyond the current state of the art even for server-class models. Metric 3D grounding without a depth sensor (LiDAR or structured light) requires SLAM pipelines, not a VLM inference call. The A17 Pro and Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 do have capable NPUs, but coordinating CPU-GPU-NPU across a full-duplex VLA + TTS + spatial audio pipeline simultaneously is an unsolved systems engineering problem, not a product configuration.\n\nWhat IS technically sound: 4-layer spatial audio on iOS/Android is mature. On-device LLM inference at 1-3B params is real and fast. Zero-shot voice cloning with short samples exists in cloud form. Differential privacy for cloud interactions is well-understood. Basic AR landmark overlay (Google Lens-class) works today.\n\nNet: the concept cherry-picks real research directions and combines them into an integration that would require 3-5 simultaneous breakthroughs, plus a hardware form-factor shift to always-on wearable cameras, none of which are on a predictable 2026 path.",

Monetization is conspicuously absent from the PRD, which is a red flag at the market readiness stage.

The 25% Day-30 retention target is notably ambitious \u2014 typical travel utility apps see 10-15% at D30, and novelty-driven apps often spike then crater.

          "reasoning": "AURA presents a genuinely novel and evocative concept \u2014 the 'Temporal Lens' framing is memorable and the core experience (historical figures whispering to you as you walk past landmarks) has real delight potential. However, several structural UX decisions introduce significant friction that could prevent users from ever reaching that magical core.\n\nThe central tension is a classic Zero-UI paradox: the product's entire identity is invisibility, yet Zero-UI interfaces suffer acutely from the Gulf of Execution \u2014 users cannot perceive affordances, cannot discover what the system can do, and cannot recover gracefully when it fails or misbehaves. This has historically killed otherwise promising ambient/proactive products (Google Glass, Amazon Halo, early Alexa ambient modes). The PRD has no onboarding strategy, which is arguably the most critical UX artifact for a Zero-UI product \u2014 without scaffolded trust-building, users will experience the proactive 'whisper' as startling or intrusive rather than magical.\n\nThe proactive initiation model ('AI identifies landmarks before user raises phone') is unproven at scale. Every successful voice AI to date (Siri, Alexa, Hey Google, ChatGPT voice) is reactive \u2014 user-initiated. Flipping this to proactive AI-initiated interaction is a UX paradigm shift that requires extremely high precision and contextual sensitivity. A single mis-timed or irrelevant whisper in the first session could permanently erode user trust.\n\nThe Zurich context adds cultural friction. Zurich is notably reserved \u2014 public voice interactions with devices carry social stigma. The PRD doesn't acknowledge this, yet it's the pilot city. Spatial audio is also severely degraded in urban noise environments (trams, traffic, crowds on Bahnhofstrasse), which could undercut the immersion score target.\n\nAlways-on camera for 'VLA processing before user raises phone' will face visceral perception resistance. Even with strong on-device privacy architecture, users are deeply uncomfortable with cameras that watch without their active command. The technical privacy story is solid but the perceived privacy story is not addressed.\n\nOn the positive side: the 4-layer spatial audio architecture is thoughtful and well-decomposed. Character Constitutions for historical figures maintaining integrity is smart content design. The 'Discovery Habit' framing for locals shows understanding of long-term retention. Digital Souvenirs as journey artifacts are a clever retention and shareability mechanic. The 10-turn natural conversation target, if achievable, would represent genuinely compelling engagement.",

The team clearly has sophisticated taste. However, the submission has a foundational contradiction that no amount of polish can paper over: the entire Zero-UI premise collapses at the hardware layer. The 'proactive identification before user raises phone' is physically impossible on a smartphone \u2014 the camera is occluded in a pocket. This isn't a roadmap gap; it's a physics constraint. The PRD is written as if an always-on exterior camera (AR glasses, wearable) is the form factor, but never states this. Every downstream claim \u2014 VLA streaming, centimeter spatial grounding, ambient whisper initiation \u2014 inherits this broken assumption. Compounding this: the named technical stack (MiniCPM-o 4.5, MobileLLM-Pro P1, NeuTTS-Nano, Qwen3-VL Nano with centimeter 3D grounding) does not exist as shipping or reliably roadmapped product. This makes feasibility assessment impossible \u2014 the council cannot evaluate a stack it cannot verify. On the market side, the graveyard of AR tourism apps (Detour, Layar, Wikitude, Field Trip) is not just historical trivia \u2014 it signals a structural adoption problem with location-triggered experiences that the PRD does not address. The absence of any monetization model at this stage of spec is a red flag, not an oversight. Platform-level threats from Google Maps + Gemini Live and Apple Maps + Vision are existential, not peripheral. The Zurich pilot is strategically smart for cultural richness but creates a cultural friction the PRD ignores: Zurich is reserved, public voice interaction carries stigma, and urban noise (trams, Bahnhofstrasse crowds) will materially degrade the 4-layer spatial audio experience that is central to the immersion score target. The UX concern most likely to kill the product before the platform giants get there is the Zero-UI onboarding gap \u2014 there is no scaffolded trust-building described, and a single mis-timed proactive whisper in the first session is a permanent churn event. The 10-turn natural conversation target and Digital Souvenirs mechanic are genuinely strong ideas, but they require users to survive onboarding first.
