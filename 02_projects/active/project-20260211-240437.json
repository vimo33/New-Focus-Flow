  "description": "# Overture: Live Music Meets Local Radio\n## Concept Note v2.0\n\n**Date:** May 2025  \n**Author:** Focus Flow AI Council Submission  \n**Status:** Concept Development\n\n---\n\n## Executive Summary\n\n**Overture** is a two-tier platform connecting live musicians with venues and commercial radio in Switzerland, starting with Zurich. We solve three problems simultaneously:\n\n1. **For Students:** Bridge the gap between conservatory training and professional gigging\n2. **For Venues:** Access affordable, quality live music without booking hassles\n3. **For Radio Operators:** Legal, curated background music that replaces generic Spotify playlists\n\n### The Model\n\n- **Tier 1 (Campus):** Music students perform live gigs (CHF 100-150), build portfolios, receive mentorship\n- **Tier 2 (Pro):** Established musicians command premium rates (CHF 200-400), get commercial radio distribution\n- **Overture Business:** Subscription radio service (CHF 49-699/month) streaming Pro-tier recordings to cafés, hotels, retail\n\n### Year 1 Targets\n\n- **60 Campus gigs** + **30 Pro gigs** booked\n- **15 radio subscribers** (cafés, hotels, offices)\n- **CHF 145,000 revenue** | CHF 80,000 profit\n- Break-even by Month 9\n\n---\n\n## The Problem\n\n### 1. The Student Gap\nMusic conservatory students in Zurich (ZHdK, Konservatorium Zürich) face a **transition paradox**:\n\n- **Training:** World-class classical/jazz education\n- **Reality:** No clear path from student recitals → professional gigs\n- **Result:** 60% quit music within 2 years of graduation\n\n**Why It Happens:**\n- Venues don't know how to find students\n- Students don't know how to price/market themselves\n- No mentorship bridging education → profession\n\n### 2. The Venue Struggle\nSmall venues (cafés, wine bars, hotel lobbies) want live music but face:\n\n- **Booking friction:** Cold-calling musicians, negotiating rates, coordinating schedules\n- **Quality risk:** \"Will they show up? Will they be good?\"\n- **Cost barrier:** Professional musicians charge CHF 300-500/gig\n\n**Result:** 70% of suitable venues never book live music, defaulting to Spotify playlists.\n\n### 3. The Radio Compliance Problem\nBusinesses using Spotify/Apple Music for background audio risk:\n\n- **SUISA fines** (up to CHF 10,000 for commercial use of consumer streaming)\n- **Limited control** over playlists (ads, explicit content, algorithm chaos)\n- **No local connection** to the music being played\n\n**Gap:** No affordable, legal, locally-curated radio alternative exists below CHF 500/month enterprise solutions.\n\n---\n\n## The Solution\n\n### Platform Overview\n\n**Overture** is a three-sided marketplace:\n\n1. **Musicians** create profiles, upload recordings, accept gig requests\n2. **Venues** browse artists, book performances, leave reviews\n3. **Radio Subscribers** stream curated live-session playlists to their businesses\n\n### Tier 1: Campus (Students)\n\n**Who:**\n- Current students at ZHdK, Konservatorium Zürich, or equivalent\n- Recent graduates (within 2 years)\n\n**What They Get:**\n- Gig matching with vetted venues\n- Portfolio-building tools (recordings, reviews, press kit)\n- Mentorship from Pro-tier musicians\n- Path to Pro tier upon graduation\n\n**Pricing:**\n- Gigs pay CHF 100-150 (1-2 hours)\n- Platform takes 15% commission\n- Musicians keep 85% (CHF 85-128 per gig)\n\n**Value Prop:**\n\"Get paid to practice. Build your portfolio. Learn from pros.\"\n\n---\n\n### Tier 2: Pro (Established Musicians)\n\n**Who:**\n- Professional musicians with 3+ years experience\n- Conservatory alumni who graduated from Campus tier\n- Musicians with existing client bases\n\n**What They Get:**\n- Access to premium venues (hotels, upscale bars, corporate events)\n- Commercial radio distribution (their recordings streamed to Overture Business subscribers)\n- Higher rates (CHF 200-400/gig)\n- Optional mentorship income (paid to advise Campus musicians)\n\n**Pricing:**\n- Gigs pay CHF 200-400 (2-3 hours)\n- Platform takes 20% commission\n- Musicians keep 80% (CHF 160-320 per gig)\n- Radio royalties: CHF 0.10 per stream (paid quarterly)\n\n**Value Prop:**\n\"Premium gigs. Radio exposure. Give back to the next generation.\"\n\n---\n\n### Overture Business (Radio Service)\n\n**What It Is:**\nCommercial-licensed background music streamed to businesses, featuring live-session recordings from Pro-tier musicians.\n\n**Plans:**\n\n| Tier | Price/Month | Features |\n|------|-------------|----------|\n| **Café** | CHF 49 | 1 location, 10 curated playlists, weekly updates |\n| **Boutique** | CHF 149 | 3 locations, custom playlists, genre control |\n| **Hotel** | CHF 699 | Unlimited locations, API integration, white-label |\n\n**Content:**\n- 100% live recordings from Overture Pro musicians\n- Curated by genre: Jazz, Classical, Indie, Acoustic, Lounge\n- Recorded during actual gigs (authentic, high-quality)\n- SUISA-compliant, fully licensed\n\n**Value Prop:**\n\"Legal. Local. Live. Music your customers will actually remember.\"\n\n---\n\n## The Flywheel\n\n### How the Tiers Connect\n\n1. **Campus students** perform at small venues → build portfolios → get recorded\n2. **Best recordings** enter the radio catalog → generate passive income\n3. **Students graduate** → move to Pro tier → access premium venues\n4. **Pro musicians** mentor Campus artists → pass down \"starter venues\" when they move up\n5. **Radio subscribers** discover musicians via streams → book them for private events\n6. **Venues** get comfortable with Campus artists → willing to pay more for Pro-tier later\n\n**Network Effects:**\n- More students → more affordable gigs → more venues join\n- More venues → more recordings → better radio content\n- More radio subscribers → more artist exposure → more gig requests\n\n---\n\n## Revenue Model\n\n### Income Streams\n\n| Source | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 |\n|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| **Campus Gigs** (15% commission) | CHF 1,080 | CHF

Practicing 4 hours/day, playing free student recitals\n- No income, wondering if music is viable long-term\n\n**With Overture:**\n- Week 1: Creates profile, uploads 3 sample tracks\n- Week 2: Booked for CHF 120 gig at Kafischnaps (2 hours, classical repertoire)\n- Month 2: Gets mentorship call with Pro violinist (prep for jazz gig)\n- Month 6: Recorded live session enters radio catalog → CHF 15/month passive income\n- Year 2: Graduates, moves to Pro tier, books CHF 300 hotel lobby gig\n\n**Outcome:** Earned CHF 1,800 in Year 1, stayed in music after graduation.\n\n---\n\n### Marco (Pro Pianist, 8 Years Experience)\n\n**Before Overture:**\n- Freelancing via personal contacts, inconsistent income\n- Frustrated that recordings sit unused on SoundCloud\n\n**With Overture:**\n- Week 1: Joins Pro tier, uploads 20 existing live recordings\n- Week 3: Booked for CHF 350 gig at Boutique Hotel (3 hours, jazz standards)\n- Month 2: Mentors 2 Campus students (CHF 100/session)\n- Month 4: 10 of his tracks added to Overture Business catalog\n- Month 6: Earns CHF 80 in radio royalties (800 streams @ CHF 0.10 each)\n\n**Outcome:** CHF 4,200 gig income + CHF 480 radio + CHF 400 mentorship = CHF 5,080 in 6 months.\n\n---\n\n### Sofia (Café Owner, Kraftwerk Bar)\n\n**Before Overture:**\n- Playing Spotify in café (technically illegal for commercial use)\n- Wanted live music but \"too much hassle to organize\"\n\n**With Overture:**\n- Week 1: Books Campus violinist for CHF 120 (Friday evening, 2 hours)\n- Week 4: Customers loved it, books monthly residency (same artist, CHF 100/week)\n- Month 3: Upgrades to Overture Business radio (CHF 49/month, Café plan)\n- Month 6: Switches to Pro-tier jazz pianist for special events (CHF 250/gig)\n\n**Outcome:** CHF 500/month budget (radio + weekly Campus gig) replaced SUISA risk, boosted Friday foot traffic 30%.\n\n---\n\n## Technical Architecture\n\n### MVP Stack (Months 1-6)\n\n**Frontend:**\n- Next.js (React framework)\n- Tailwind CSS (UI)\n- Vercel (hosting)\n\n**Backend:**\n- Supabase (Postgres database + auth)\n- Stripe (payments)\n- AWS S3 (audio file storage)\n\n**Radio Infrastructure:**\n- Icecast (open-source streaming server)\n- Liquidsoap (playlist automation)\n- Cloudflare Stream (CDN for delivery)\n\n**Cost:** ~CHF 200/month for 100 users\n\n---\n\n### Phase 2 Additions (Months 7-12)\n\n- **Mobile Apps:** React Native (iOS/Android)\n- **Analytics:** Mixpanel (user behavior tracking)\n- **CRM:** Airtable → HubSpot migration\n- **Radio Upgrade:** Custom web player (white-label for Hotel tier)\n\n---\n\n## Competitive Landscape\n\n### Direct Competitors\n\n| Competitor | Model | Weaknesses |\n|------------|-------|------------|\n| **Gigmit** | Musician booking platform (EU-wide) | No student focus, no radio, 20% commission |\n| **Gigstarter** | Dutch booking site | Not localized for Switzerland, no Swiss licensing |\n| **SoundReef** | Alternative to SUISA licensing | No artist discovery, pure licensing play |\n\n**Our Differentiation:**\n1. **Two-tier model** (students + pros) = mission + sustainability\n2. **Radio integration** = passive income for musicians\n3. **Local focus** = deep Swiss market knowledge, SUISA compliance\n\n---\n\n### Indirect Competitors\n\n- **Spotify for Business** (CHF 500+/month, no local curation)\n- **Direct Booking** (high friction, no platform trust)\n- **SUISA Direct Licensing** (complex, expensive)\n\n**Our Advantage:** We're 10x cheaper than Spotify Business, 10x easier than direct booking.\n\n---\n\n## Risks & Mitigation\n\n### Risk 1: Musician Quality (Campus Tier)\n\n**Threat:** Venues get burned by low-quality student performances.\n\n**Mitigation:**\n- Audition process (submit 3 recordings + video)\n- Mentorship pairing (Pro reviews Campus artists before first gig)\n- Guarantee: Free replacement gig if venue is unsatisfied\n\n---\n\n### Risk 2: Radio Content Volume\n\n**Threat:** Not enough Pro recordings to fill 24/7 radio streams.\n\n**Mitigation:**\n- License 200 tracks from existing Swiss artists (one-time fee)\n- Record 2-3 Campus gigs/week (even Campus tracks can fill daytime slots)\n- Partner with ZHdK archives (student recital recordings)\n\n---\n\n### Risk 3: SUISA Complexity\n\n**Threat:** Licensing costs spiral or compliance gaps emerge.\n\n**Mitigation:**\n- Pre-negotiate blanket license with SUISA (CHF 500/month flat rate for <10,000 streams)\n- Legal review before launch (CHF 2,000 budget)\n- Use existing SoundReef model as template\n\n---\n\n### Risk 4: Graduation Churn\n\n**Threat:** Campus artists leave after 2 years.\n\n**Mitigation:**\n- Pro tier upgrade path (retention incentive)\n- Alumni network (graduated students recruit current students)\n- Mentorship income (Pro artists stay engaged via teaching)\n\n---\n\n## Success Metrics\n\n### Year 1 KPIs\n\n| Metric | Target | Measurement |\n|--------|--------|-------------|\n| **Total Musicians** | 50 (35 Campus, 15 Pro) | Platform signups |\n| **Gigs Booked** | 90 (60 Campus, 30 Pro) | Completed transactions |\n| **Radio Subscribers** | 15 | Active paying accounts |\n| **Revenue** | CHF 145,000 | Stripe dashboard |\n| **Musician Satisfaction** | 4.5/5 avg rating | Post-gig survey |\n| **Venue Retention** | 60% rebook within 3 months | CRM tracking |\n\n---\n\n### Year 2 Goals\n\n- **200 musicians** (130 Campus, 70 Pro)\n- **600 gigs** (400 Campus, 200 Pro)\n- **60 radio subscribers**\n- **CHF 355,800 revenue**\n- Expand to Bern + Basel\n\n---\n\n## Financial Projections (3-Year)\n\n### Revenue Growth\n\n| Year | Campus Gigs | Pro Gigs | Radio Subs | Total Revenue |\n|------|-------------|----------|------------|---------------|\n| **1** | CHF 1,080 | CHF 1,800 | CHF 142,120 | **CHF 145,000** |\n| **2** | CHF 5,400 | CHF 9,600 | CHF 340,800 | **CHF 355,800** |\n| **3** | CHF 12,960 | CHF 24,000 | CHF 568,000 | **CHF 604,960** |\n\n### Profitability\n\n| Year | Revenue | Costs | Profit | Margin |\n|------|---------|-------|--------|--------|\n| **1** | CHF 145,000 | CHF 66,000 | **CHF 79,000** | 54% |\n| **2** | CHF 355,800 | CHF 120,000 | **CHF 235,800** | 66% |\n| **3** | CHF 604,960 | CHF 180,000 | **CHF 424,960** | 70% |\n\n**Assumptions:**\n- Radio subscriber growth: 15 → 60 → 100 (mostly Café tier @ CHF 49/month)\n- Gig frequency: Campus = 1.5/month avg, Pro = 2.5/month avg\n- Churn: 20% annual (offset by new signups)\n\n---\n\n## Funding Ask\n\n### Bootstrap Path (No External Funding)\n\n- **Month 0:** CHF 10,000 personal investment (MVP development)\n- **Months 1-3:** Reinvest first gig commissions into marketing\n- **Month 9:** Break-even from radio subscriptions\n- **Month 12:** CHF 30,000 profit reinvested into Year 2 expansion\n\n**Timeline to Profitability:** 9 months\n\n---\n\n### Alternative: Seed Funding (Optional)\n\n**Ask:** CHF 100,000  \n**Use of Funds:**\n- CHF 50,000 → Platform development (hire 1 FTE developer)\n- CHF 30,000 → Marketing (Facebook ads, venue partnerships)\n- CHF 20,000 → Legal/licensing (SUISA negotiation, terms of service)\n\n**Investor Return:**\n- 15% equity for CHF 100K (pre-money valuation: CHF 566K)\n- Exit via acquisition (Year 3-5, estimated CHF 2-3M valuation)\n- Comparable: Gigmit (Germany) acquired for €5M in 2019\n\n---\n\n## Next Steps (30-Day Action Plan)\n\n### Week 1: Foundation\n- [ ] Register company (GmbH, Zurich)\n- [ ] Set up Stripe + bank account\n- [ ] Build landing page (Next.js + Vercel)\n\n### Week 2: Licensing\n- [ ] Schedule SUISA consultation\n- [ ] Draft musician/venue contracts\n- [ ] Legal review (terms of service)\n\n### Week 3: Recruitment\n- [ ] Reach out to 20 ZHdK students (via faculty contacts)\n- [ ] Cold-email 30 Kreis 4/5 cafés\n- [ ] Record pilot gig (test audio workflow)\n\n### Week 4: Launch\n- [ ] Onboard 5 Campus musicians\n- [ ] Book 3 pilot gigs (free for venues)\n- [ ] Collect feedback, iterate\n\n**Month 2 Goal:** First paid gig + first radio subscriber.\n\n---\n\n## Why This Works\n\n### 1. Triple Win\n- **Students** get income + mentorship\n- **Venues** get affordable, quality music\n- **Radio subscribers** get legal, local playlists\n\n### 2. The Flywheel\n- Each tier feeds the others (students → pros → radio → gigs)\n- Network effects kick in at 50 musicians (critical mass)\n\n### 3. Swiss Timing\n- SUISA enforcement increasing (fines creating demand)\n- Post-COVID venues want \"experiences\" (live music = differentiator)\n- ZHdK students need income (cost of living crisis)\n\n### 4. Proven Models\n- **Gigmit** (booking platform) = €5M exit\n- **SoundReef** (licensing alternative) = profitable in Italy\n- **Sofar Sounds** (curated live music) = $25M raised\n\n**Overture combines all three.**\n\n---\n\n## Team\n\n### Founder (You)\n- Background: [Add your experience]\n- Role: CEO, business development, venue partnerships\n\n### Advisors (Needed)\n- **Music Industry:** ZHdK faculty or alumni (credibility with students)\n- **Legal:** Swiss IP/licensing lawyer (SUISA navigation)\n- **Tech:** CTO or senior developer (platform architecture)\n\n---\n\n## Appendix A: Sample Playlist (Overture Business)\n\n**\"Zürich Mornings\" (Café Tier)**\n1.

Upsell:** Cross-sell gig bookers into radio subscriptions\n\n**Success Metric:** Break-even by Month 9\n\n---\n\n## User Journeys\n\n### Lena (Campus Student, Violinist)\n\n**Before Overture:**\n- Practicing 4 hours/day, playing free student recitals\n- No income, wondering if music is viable long-term\n\n**With Overture:**\n- Week 1: Creates profile, uploads 3 sample tracks\n- Week 2: Booked for CHF 120 gig at Kafischnaps (2 hours, classical repertoire)\n- Month 2: Gets mentorship call with Pro violinist (prep for jazz gig)\n- Month 6: Recorded live session enters radio catalog → CHF 15/month passive income\n- Year 2: Graduates, moves to Pro tier, books CHF 300 hotel lobby gig\n\n**Outcome:** Earned CHF 1,800 in Year 1, stayed in music after graduation.\n\n---\n\n### Marco (Pro Pianist, 8 Years Experience)\n\n**Before Overture:**\n- Freelancing via personal contacts, inconsistent income\n- Frustrated that recordings sit unused on SoundCloud\n\n**With Overture:**\n- Week 1: Joins Pro tier, uploads 20 existing live recordings\n- Week 3: Booked for CHF 350 gig at Boutique Hotel (3 hours, jazz standards)\n- Month 2: Mentors 2 Campus students (CHF 100/session)\n- Month 4: 10 of his tracks added to Overture Business catalog\n- Month 6: Earns CHF 80 in radio royalties (800 streams @ CHF 0.10 each)\n\n**Outcome:** CHF 4,200 gig income + CHF 480 radio + CHF 400 mentorship = CHF 5,080 in 6 months.\n\n---\n\n### Sofia (Café Owner, Kraftwerk Bar)\n\n**Before Overture:**\n- Playing Spotify in café (technically illegal for commercial use)\n- Wanted live music but \"too much hassle to organize\"\n\n**With Overture:**\n- Week 1: Books Campus violinist for CHF 120 (Friday evening, 2 hours)\n- Week 4: Customers loved it, books monthly residency (same artist, CHF 100/week)\n- Month 3: Upgrades to Overture Business radio (CHF 49/month, Café plan)\n- Month 6: Switches to Pro-tier jazz pianist for special events (CHF 250/gig)\n\n**Outcome:** CHF 500/month budget (radio + weekly Campus gig) replaced SUISA risk, boosted Friday foot traffic 30%.\n\n---\n\n## Technical Architecture\n\n### MVP Stack (Months 1-6)\n\n**Frontend:**\n- Next.js (React framework)\n- Tailwind CSS (UI)\n- Vercel (hosting)\n\n**Backend:**\n- Supabase (Postgres database + auth)\n- Stripe (payments)\n- AWS S3 (audio file storage)\n\n**Radio Infrastructure:**\n- Icecast (open-source streaming server)\n- Liquidsoap (playlist automation)\n- Cloudflare Stream (CDN for delivery)\n\n**Cost:** ~CHF 200/month for 100 users\n\n---\n\n### Phase 2 Additions (Months 7-12)\n\n- **Mobile Apps:** React Native (iOS/Android)\n- **Analytics:** Mixpanel (user behavior tracking)\n- **CRM:** Airtable → HubSpot migration\n- **Radio Upgrade:** Custom web player (white-label for Hotel tier)\n\n---\n\n## Competitive Landscape\n\n### Direct Competitors\n\n| Competitor | Model | Weaknesses |\n|------------|-------|------------|\n| **Gigmit** | Musician booking platform (EU-wide) | No student focus, no radio, 20% commission |\n| **Gigstarter** | Dutch booking site | Not localized for Switzerland, no Swiss licensing |\n| **SoundReef** | Alternative to SUISA licensing | No artist discovery, pure licensing play |\n\n**Our Differentiation:**\n1. **Two-tier model** (students + pros) = mission + sustainability\n2. **Radio integration** = passive income for musicians\n3. **Local focus** = deep Swiss market knowledge, SUISA compliance\n\n---\n\n### Indirect Competitors\n\n- **Spotify for Business** (CHF 500+/month, no local curation)\n- **Direct Booking** (high friction, no platform trust)\n- **SUISA Direct Licensing** (complex, expensive)\n\n**Our Advantage:** We're 10x cheaper than Spotify Business, 10x easier than direct booking.\n\n---\n\n## Risks & Mitigation\n\n### Risk 1: Musician Quality (Campus Tier)\n\n**Threat:** Venues get burned by low-quality student performances.\n\n**Mitigation:**\n- Audition process (submit 3 recordings + video)\n- Mentorship pairing (Pro reviews Campus artists before first gig)\n- Guarantee: Free replacement gig if venue is unsatisfied\n\n---\n\n### Risk 2: Radio Content Volume\n\n**Threat:** Not enough Pro recordings to fill 24/7 radio streams.\n\n**Mitigation:**\n- License 200 tracks from existing Swiss artists (one-time fee)\n- Record 2-3 Campus gigs/week (even Campus tracks can fill daytime slots)\n- Partner with ZHdK archives (student recital recordings)\n\n---\n\n### Risk 3: SUISA Complexity\n\n**Threat:** Licensing costs spiral or compliance gaps emerge.\n\n**Mitigation:**\n- Pre-negotiate blanket license with SUISA (CHF 500/month flat rate for <10,000 streams)\n- Legal review before launch (CHF 2,000 budget)\n- Use existing SoundReef model as template\n\n---\n\n### Risk 4: Graduation Churn\n\n**Threat:** Campus artists leave after 2 years.\n\n**Mitigation:**\n- Pro tier upgrade path (retention incentive)\n- Alumni network (graduated students recruit current students)\n- Mentorship income (Pro artists stay engaged via teaching)\n\n---\n\n## Success Metrics\n\n### Year 1 KPIs\n\n| Metric | Target | Measurement |\n|--------|--------|-------------|\n| **Total Musicians** | 50 (35 Campus, 15 Pro) | Platform signups |\n| **Gigs Booked** | 90 (60 Campus, 30 Pro) | Completed transactions |\n| **Radio Subscribers** | 15 | Active paying accounts |\n| **Revenue** | CHF 145,000 | Stripe dashboard |\n| **Musician Satisfaction** | 4.5/5 avg rating | Post-gig survey |\n| **Venue Retention** | 60% rebook within 3 months | CRM tracking |\n\n---\n\n### Year 2 Goals\n\n- **200 musicians** (130 Campus, 70 Pro)\n- **600 gigs** (400 Campus, 200 Pro)\n- **60 radio subscribers**\n- **CHF 355,800 revenue**\n- Expand to Bern + Basel\n\n---\n\n## Financial Projections (3-Year)\n\n### Revenue Growth\n\n| Year | Campus Gigs | Pro Gigs | Radio Subs | Total Revenue |\n|------|-------------|----------|------------|---------------|\n| **1** | CHF 1,080 | CHF 1,800 | CHF 142,120 | **CHF 145,000** |\n| **2** | CHF 5,400 | CHF 9,600 | CHF 340,800 | **CHF 355,800** |\n| **3** | CHF 12,960 | CHF 24,000 | CHF 568,000 | **CHF 604,960** |\n\n### Profitability\n\n| Year | Revenue | Costs | Profit | Margin |\n|------|---------|-------|--------|--------|\n| **1** | CHF 145,000 | CHF 66,000 | **CHF 79,000** | 54% |\n| **2** | CHF 355,800 | CHF 120,000 | **CHF 235,800** | 66% |\n| **3** | CHF 604,960 | CHF 180,000 | **CHF 424,960** | 70% |\n\n**Assumptions:**\n- Radio subscriber growth: 15 → 60 → 100 (mostly Café tier @ CHF 49/month)\n- Gig frequency: Campus = 1.5/month avg, Pro = 2.5/month avg\n- Churn: 20% annual (offset by new signups)\n\n---\n\n## Funding Ask\n\n### Bootstrap Path (No External Funding)\n\n- **Month 0:** CHF 10,000 personal investment (MVP development)\n- **Months 1-3:** Reinvest first gig commissions into marketing\n- **Month 9:** Break-even from radio subscriptions\n- **Month 12:** CHF 30,000 profit reinvested into Year 2 expansion\n\n**Timeline to Profitability:** 9 months\n\n---\n\n### Alternative: Seed Funding (Optional)\n\n**Ask:** CHF 100,000  \n**Use of Funds:**\n- CHF 50,000 → Platform development (hire 1 FTE developer)\n- CHF 30,000 → Marketing (Facebook ads, venue partnerships)\n- CHF 20,000 → Legal/licensing (SUISA negotiation, terms of service)\n\n**Investor Return:**\n- 15% equity for CHF 100K (pre-money valuation: CHF 566K)\n- Exit via acquisition (Year 3-5, estimated CHF 2-3M valuation)\n- Comparable: Gigmit (Germany) acquired for €5M in 2019\n\n---\n\n## Next Steps (30-Day Action Plan)\n\n### Week 1: Foundation\n- [ ] Register company (GmbH, Zurich)\n- [ ] Set up Stripe + bank account\n- [ ] Build landing page (Next.js + Vercel)\n\n### Week 2: Licensing\n- [ ] Schedule SUISA consultation\n- [ ] Draft musician/venue contracts\n- [ ] Legal review (terms of service)\n\n### Week 3: Recruitment\n- [ ] Reach out to 20 ZHdK students (via faculty contacts)\n- [ ] Cold-email 30 Kreis 4/5 cafés\n- [ ] Record pilot gig (test audio workflow)\n\n### Week 4: Launch\n- [ ] Onboard 5 Campus musicians\n- [ ] Book 3 pilot gigs (free for venues)\n- [ ] Collect feedback, iterate\n\n**Month 2 Goal:** First paid gig + first radio subscriber.\n\n---\n\n## Why This Works\n\n### 1. Triple Win\n- **Students** get income + mentorship\n- **Venues** get affordable, quality music\n- **Radio subscribers** get legal, local playlists\n\n### 2. The Flywheel\n- Each tier feeds the others (students → pros → radio → gigs)\n- Network effects kick in at 50 musicians (critical mass)\n\n### 3. Swiss Timing\n- SUISA enforcement increasing (fines creating demand)\n- Post-COVID venues want \"experiences\" (live music = differentiator)\n- ZHdK students need income (cost of living crisis)\n\n### 4. Proven Models\n- **Gigmit** (booking platform) = €5M exit\n- **SoundReef** (licensing alternative) = profitable in Italy\n- **Sofar Sounds** (curated live music) = $25M raised\n\n**Overture combines all three.**\n\n---\n\n## Team\n\n### Founder (You)\n- Background: [Add your experience]\n- Role: CEO, business development, venue partnerships\n\n### Advisors (Needed)\n- **Music Industry:** ZHdK faculty or alumni (credibility with students)\n- **Legal:** Swiss IP/licensing lawyer (SUISA navigation)\n- **Tech:** CTO or senior developer (platform architecture)\n\n---\n\n## Appendix A: Sample Playlist (Overture Business)\n\n**\"Zürich Mornings\" (Café Tier)**\n1.

The concept combines three distinct products (booking marketplace, radio streaming service, licensing compliance) each requiring specialized execution. The technical stack is sound (Next.js, Supabase, Icecast), but the CHF 10K bootstrap budget is unrealistic for the scope—realistically needs CHF 50-100K for 12-18 month runway. The aggressive 9-month break-even timeline underestimates B2B sales cycles (radio subscriptions) and the time needed to build content library and network effects.

            "reasoning": "Overture addresses real problems (student income gap, venue booking friction, SUISA compliance) with a creative three-sided marketplace model. However, the ROI is questionable due to several critical issues:\n\n1. **Revenue Math Error**: Year 1 projects CHF 142K from 15 radio subscribers, but even 15 Hotel-tier accounts (CHF 699/month) = CHF 125,820/year. If mostly Café tier (CHF 49/month as pitched), 15 subscribers = CHF 8,820/year - a 93% gap. This undermines all financial projections.\n\n2. **Radio Dependency Risk**: 98% of Year 1 revenue relies on the radio service - the least-proven component. If businesses prefer to risk SUISA enforcement or Spotify launches a competitive product, the model collapses.\n\n3. **Small TAM**: Zurich conservatories have ~500 students total; suitable venues maybe 100-200. Year 3 ceiling is likely CHF 200-300K revenue, not CHF 605K.\n\n4. **High Complexity**: This is effectively 3 businesses (booking platform + mentorship network + streaming radio). Each alone is challenging; combined execution risk is very high.\n\n5. **Weak Moat**: Existing platforms (Gigmit, Gigstarter) could add student tiers; Spotify could undercut radio pricing. No clear defensibility.\n\n**What Works**: Problem validation is strong, flywheel concept is sound, and helping students is valuable socially.\n\n**What Doesn't**: Financial projections are unreliable, market is too small for venture-scale returns, and execution requires expertise in music licensing, streaming infrastructure, and marketplace dynamics simultaneously.\n\nThis could work as a lifestyle business (CHF 50-80K/year income for founder) but not as a high-ROI venture. The effort-to-impact ratio is unfavorable compared to simpler solutions (e.g., a Notion database connecting students to venues).",

            "reasoning": "Overture addresses real pain points in a well-defined niche, but faces significant market validation and execution challenges. **Strengths:** (1) Triple-sided value proposition is compelling - students need income/transition paths, venues struggle with booking friction, and SUISA compliance creates genuine urgency for legal background music. (2) Geographic focus on Zurich with specific institutions (ZHdK, Konservatorium) enables deep partnerships. (3) The two-tier flywheel (students → pros → radio → referrals) is clever. (4) Post-COVID timing favors experiential offerings. **Critical Weaknesses:** (1) Revenue projections are mathematically inconsistent - CHF 142K from 15 radio subscribers implies ~CHF 790/month average, but pricing is CHF 49-699 with most targeting the low end. Actual Year 1 radio revenue likely ~CHF 25-40K, not CHF 142K. (2) Market size is constrained - Zurich has maybe 500-800 relevant music students and 200-400 suitable venues; saturation risk by Year 2.

The concept combines three distinct products (booking marketplace, radio streaming service, licensing compliance) each requiring specialized execution. The technical stack is sound (Next.js, Supabase, Icecast), but the CHF 10K bootstrap budget is unrealistic for the scope—realistically needs CHF 50-100K for 12-18 month runway. The aggressive 9-month break-even timeline underestimates B2B sales cycles (radio subscriptions) and the time needed to build content library and network effects. Core technical work is achievable in 6-9 months with a competent full-stack developer, but simultaneous execution on platform, radio infrastructure, content creation, and legal compliance stretches thin.",

          "reasoning": "Overture addresses real problems (student income gap, venue booking friction, SUISA compliance) with a creative three-sided marketplace model. However, the ROI is questionable due to several critical issues:\n\n1. **Revenue Math Error**: Year 1 projects CHF 142K from 15 radio subscribers, but even 15 Hotel-tier accounts (CHF 699/month) = CHF 125,820/year. If mostly Café tier (CHF 49/month as pitched), 15 subscribers = CHF 8,820/year - a 93% gap. This undermines all financial projections.\n\n2. **Radio Dependency Risk**: 98% of Year 1 revenue relies on the radio service - the least-proven component. If businesses prefer to risk SUISA enforcement or Spotify launches a competitive product, the model collapses.\n\n3. **Small TAM**: Zurich conservatories have ~500 students total; suitable venues maybe 100-200. Year 3 ceiling is likely CHF 200-300K revenue, not CHF 605K.\n\n4. **High Complexity**: This is effectively 3 businesses (booking platform + mentorship network + streaming radio). Each alone is challenging; combined execution risk is very high.\n\n5. **Weak Moat**: Existing platforms (Gigmit, Gigstarter) could add student tiers; Spotify could undercut radio pricing. No clear defensibility.\n\n**What Works**: Problem validation is strong, flywheel concept is sound, and helping students is valuable socially.\n\n**What Doesn't**: Financial projections are unreliable, market is too small for venture-scale returns, and execution requires expertise in music licensing, streaming infrastructure, and marketplace dynamics simultaneously.\n\nThis could work as a lifestyle business (CHF 50-80K/year income for founder) but not as a high-ROI venture. The effort-to-impact ratio is unfavorable compared to simpler solutions (e.g., a Notion database connecting students to venues).",

      "synthesized_reasoning": "Overture identifies legitimate pain points—music students need performance income and career bridges, venues struggle with booking friction, and SUISA enforcement creates demand for legal background music. The three-sided flywheel concept is creative. However, the proposal suffers from critical flaws that make it unviable in its current form:\n\n**Fatal Financial Error:** Year 1 projects CHF 142K from 15 radio subscribers, but the math doesn't work. Even 15 Hotel-tier accounts (CHF 699/month) = CHF 126K annually. If targeting mostly Café tier (CHF 49/month), 15 subscribers = CHF 8.8K/year—a 93% gap. This error cascades through all projections, overstating viability by 3-16x.\n\n**Execution Complexity vs. Resources:** This isn't one business—it's three (booking marketplace + streaming infrastructure + licensing compliance). The CHF 10K bootstrap budget and 9-month break-even timeline severely underestimate requirements. Realistically needs CHF 50-100K and 12-18 months. SUISA licensing alone could consume CHF 10K+ in legal fees, and the assumed CHF 500/month flat rate is unvalidated.\n\n**Market Size Ceiling:** Zurich has ~500 music students and ~200-400 suitable venues. This constrains Year 3 revenue to CHF 200-300K, not CHF 605K. Three-sided marketplace dynamics make bootstrapping extremely difficult—you need simultaneous critical mass across students, venues, AND radio subscribers.\n\n**Alignment Red Flag:** Submitted by 'AI Council' with no personal context about available capital, time commitment, music industry background, or strategic fit. This reads as conceptual exploration, not execution readiness. The 3,000+ word plan suggests significant planning investment but unclear path to first real action.\n\n**What Could Work:** A simplified version—just the student-venue booking platform (no radio) or just curated radio (licensing existing recordings)—might be viable as a lifestyle business earning CHF 50-80K/year. But the current all-in-one model has unfavorable effort-to-impact ratio and high failure risk.",

        "**Reject the full concept as presented.** The financial projections are unreliable, scope is mismatched to market size, and execution requirements exceed stated resources.",
        "**If genuinely interested in the space, validate core assumptions first:** (1) Interview 10-15 Zurich venues to confirm SUISA enforcement urgency and willingness to pay CHF 49-150/month for local radio. (2) Talk to SUISA directly about licensing costs—get the CHF 500/month flat rate in writing before building any business model around it. (3) Survey ZHdK students about gig pricing expectations and platform interest.",
        "**Consider a dramatically simplified MVP:** Start with ONLY the student-venue booking marketplace (no radio, no Pro tier). Build a Notion database or Airtable form connecting 10 students with 10 venues. Manually coordinate 20 gigs in 3 months for CHF 2,000 total investment. If that works, layer in radio later.",
        "**Clarify personal alignment:** Determine if you have (1) CHF 50-100K available capital, (2) 12-18 months for full-time commitment, (3) music industry relationships to accelerate partnerships, and (4) willingness to accept lifestyle business returns (CHF 50-80K/year) rather than venture scale. If any answer is 'no,' this is not the right concept.",
        "**Alternative: Partner instead of build.** Approach existing platforms like Gigmit or local Swiss booking agencies with the 'student tier' idea as a white-label add-on. Let them handle infrastructure while you focus on ZHdK partnerships. Lower risk, faster validation.",
        "**Focus energy elsewhere if music isn't core to your identity/network.** The 1-2 year opportunity cost of pursuing Overture only makes sense if you have deep passion and domain expertise in Swiss music scenes. If this emerged from brainstorming rather than lived frustration, redirect to higher-leverage problems aligned with your existing strengths."
