# Necessary Beliefs Template

> **Core Framework (Todd Brown E5 Copy Method):**
> Marketing is not about magnificent words — it's about changing beliefs.
> "Stop writing copy and start crafting arguments."
> Each belief is an argument — leading the customer from their current belief to the belief that makes them buy.

## The E5 Method Principle

**Traditional approach (wrong):** Stack Power Words — "best", "most trusted", "top-rated"
**Correct approach:** Build arguments — let customers reach their own conclusion

## Belief Chain Logic

```
Some options are better than others
          ↓
Current solutions have problems
          ↓
Your brand is credible
          ↓
Your mechanism works
          ↓
I can get results
          ↓
Now is the time to act
          ↓
→ Purchase / Sign Up
```
