# Deep Research Methodology

## Why Research Matters

You need to understand your market, customers, competitors, existing solutions, what the market likes and dislikes, pain points — everything. You need a comprehensive, broad understanding of the entire space to write the most effective copy.

**Key insight:** Many copywriters think they know the market, maybe they do know some things, so they skip or ignore research entirely. This is almost always harmful because they're just guessing what the market wants to hear.

**The right approach:** The market can actually tell us what they want to hear. We can use the market's own language because you can literally take what the market says and transplant it into your sales copy, speaking to them in their language.

## Research Question Checklist

### 1. Demographics & Attitudes

**Basic questions:**
- Who is your customer? (age, gender, income, location)
- What are their attitudes? (religious, political, social, economic)
- What are their hopes and dreams?
- What are their wins and losses?
- What external forces do they believe prevent their best life?
- What biases do they have?
- Summarize in 1-3 sentences their core beliefs about life, love, and family

### 2. Existing Solutions

- What is the market already using? List them.
- What is their experience with these existing solutions?
- What does the market like about existing solutions?
- What does the market dislike about existing solutions?
- Are there horror stories about existing solutions?
- Does the market believe existing solutions work? If not, why?

### 3. Curiosity Elements

- Has anyone tried to solve the market's pain point in a very unique way? What happened?
- Are there old pre-1960s attempts to solve the problem that were unique?
- "Lost discovery" angles — people love the idea of old becoming new again, ancient wisdom

### 4. Corruption Angles

- Did the market's pain point not exist or was less severe in the past?
- Is there a belief that the problem was made worse by external forces? What forces and why?
- "Fall from Eden" angle — there were simpler times, fewer problems

### Forum Research Tips:
- Sort by replies to find most active threads
- Sort by views for email subject line inspiration

## Key Insight

> "Why is research so important? Because when you're writing copy, what are the market's hopes and dreams? 'Lose weight' is too obvious. But 'I want my husband to look at me proudly and say, that's my wife, look how amazing she is' — that's much better than 'lose weight' or 'drop two sizes.'"

The goal: Find the emotional truth behind the surface-level desire.
