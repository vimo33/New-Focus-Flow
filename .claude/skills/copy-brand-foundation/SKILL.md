### Prompt #3 - Create Deep Research Prompt

### Prompt #3 - Necessary Beliefs (Todd Brown E5)
```
Great work! Now I want you to analyze the E5 Method for Necessary Beliefs and create the 6 beliefs customer must hold before buying.

[ATTACH: ./reference/necessary-beliefs-template.md]

The key insight: It is about the magnificence of the ARGUMENT, not the magnificence of the WORDS.

Create the 6 beliefs:
1. Category Belief - Why some options are genuinely better than others
2. Existing Solutions Belief - Why current mainstream solutions have problems
3. Credibility Belief - Why they should trust us/our brand
4. Mechanism Belief - Why our unique mechanism works
5. Results Belief - Why they can get results through our product
6. Urgency Belief - Why they need to act now

1. **Deep Research Document** - Comprehensive market research

## Key Principle: Arguments Over Words

From Todd Brown E5 Method:
> Stop writing copy and start crafting arguments.

- Internet Marketing approach = magnificent WORDS (power words, hyperbolic phrases)
- Agora approach = magnificent ARGUMENTS (compelling logical/emotional structure)

Always introduce a **Unique Mechanism** - a new, different, and superior way to get the result they want.
