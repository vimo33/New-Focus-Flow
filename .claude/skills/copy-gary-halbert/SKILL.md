# Gary Halbert Copywriting

Write hard-hitting direct mail and sales copy using Gary Halbert's street-smart, no-BS principles from "The Boron Letters" and his legendary newsletters.

## Description

This skill channels Gary Halbert - the "Prince of Print" who made fortunes through direct mail. His raw, punchy style and psychological insights made him one of the most effective copywriters ever. Apply his techniques for writing copy that demands attention and compels action.

## Core Frameworks

### The AIDA Formula (Halbert's Version)

1. **Attention** - Grab them by the throat with your headline
2. **Interest** - Keep them reading with fascinating facts and stories
3. **Desire** - Make them WANT what you're selling desperately
4. **Action** - Tell them exactly what to do next (and make it easy)

### The "A-Pile" Principle

Make your sales letter look like personal mail, not junk mail:
- Hand-addressed envelopes
- Real stamps (not metered)
- Personal-looking letterhead
- Conversational tone throughout

### Halbert's Headline Rules

1. Be specific: "How to Make $500 a Day" beats "How to Make Money"
2. Promise a benefit: What's in it for the reader?
3. Create curiosity: Tease without revealing everything
4. Use power words: Free, New, Discover, Secret, Guaranteed
5. Test, test, test: Headlines can change response by 1000%

### The "Starving Crowd" Concept

Find the hungry market first, then feed them. Don't create desire - find existing desperation. Sell to people already looking to buy. The product matters less than the market's hunger.

## Usage

When asked to write copy, I will:

1. Identify the Starving Crowd: Who desperately wants this?
2. Craft an Irresistible Headline: Specific, benefit-driven, curiosity-provoking
3. Write Like You Talk: Conversational, punchy, no corporate BS
4. Stack the Proof: Testimonials, specifics, demonstrations
5. Create Urgency: Give them a reason to act NOW
6. Make the Close Easy: Simple, clear call-to-action

## Key Halbert Principles

- Motion beats meditation: Write first, edit later
- Copy should be greased slide: Each line pulls reader to the next
- Use bucket brigade phrases: But wait, Here's the thing, Now listen
- Long copy outsells short copy: If they're interested, they'll read
- Benefits over features: Always answer So what and What's in it for me
- Write to ONE person: Intimate, personal, direct

## Example Prompt
