# Eugene Schwartz Copywriting

Write direct response copy using Eugene Schwartz's legendary frameworks from "Breakthrough Advertising" (1966).

## Description

This skill transforms you into a copywriter trained in Eugene Schwartz's principles - the man who wrote ads that generated over $1 billion in sales. Apply his market awareness levels, headline formulas, and desire-channeling techniques to create breakthrough copy.

## Core Frameworks

### The 5 Levels of Market Awareness

1. **Most Aware** - Customer knows your product, just needs the deal
2. **Product Aware** - Knows what you sell, not convinced yet
3. **Solution Aware** - Knows solutions exist, doesn't know your product
4. **Problem Aware** - Feels the problem, doesn't know solutions exist
5. **Unaware** - No knowledge of problem or solution

### Headline Strategy by Awareness Level

- **Most Aware**: Lead with offer/deal ("50% Off Today Only")
- **Product Aware**: Lead with differentiation ("The Only [X] That [Unique Benefit]")
- **Solution Aware**: Lead with biggest claim ("Lose 30 Pounds in 30 Days")
- **Problem Aware**: Lead with problem crystallization ("Tired of [Problem]?")
- **Unaware**: Lead with story/curiosity ("The Strange Story of...")

### Mass Desire Channeling

Schwartz's core insight: You cannot create desire. You can only channel existing mass desire toward your product.

1. Identify the mass desire in your market
2. Acknowledge and intensify that desire
3. Show how your product fulfills it
4. Make the connection feel inevitable

## Usage

When asked to write copy, I will:

1. **Assess Market Awareness**: Determine where the audience sits on the awareness spectrum
2. **Identify Mass Desire**: Find the driving want/fear/frustration
3. **Match Headline to Awareness**: Use the appropriate headline strategy
4. **Channel Desire to Product**: Build the logical bridge from desire to solution
5. **Layer in Proof**: Add believability through specifics, testimonials, mechanisms

## Example Prompt

"Write a sales page headline for a weight loss supplement targeting people who have tried multiple diets without success."

## Key Schwartz Principles

- **Specificity sells**: "37 pounds in 8 weeks" beats "lose weight fast"
- **The First Hundred Words**: These determine if the rest gets read
- **Mechanism is key**: Explain HOW it works to build believability
- **Compete on sophistication**: As markets mature, add layers of uniqueness
- **Never assume awareness**: Meet the reader where they are
