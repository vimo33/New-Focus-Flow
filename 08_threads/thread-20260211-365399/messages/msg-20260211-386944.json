  "content": "This is exceptionally thorough — you've clearly done deep research on the regulatory landscape, market gaps, and competitive positioning. The three-engine sequencing is smart, and the Swiss-Indian arbitrage economics are compelling.\n\nThe one area that could use more specificity: **your first 5 customers**. You mention supply chain pressure, esg2go's consultant network, and thought leadership, but those are channels, not a concrete acquisition plan.\n\nWho exactly will be customer #1, and what's the tactical path to close them in months 1-3? Will you target a specific industry vertical (manufacturing suppliers to Swiss Post?), leverage a personal network connection, or cold outreach to companies in a specific canton?",
