  "content": "## Council Readiness Audit\n\nHere's how your concept maps to what the council evaluates:\n\n### ✅ **Well-covered:**\n- **Problem & Solution Mechanism** — The safety monitoring pain point is clear, and your technical architecture (edge-first, ONVIF/RTSP, PPE templates, foundation→calibration→fine-tuning) is very concrete with research-backed choices\n- **MVP Scope** — Phase 1 roadmap is tight and credible (8-12 weeks, explicit feature list)\n- **Technical Feasibility** — Hardware specs, protocol choices, dataset strategy, and domain-gap mitigation are all grounded and realistic\n\n### ⚠️ **Needs strengthening:**\n- **Target Users** — \"Indian factories (Bangalore/Chennai)\" is too broad; the council will want buyer persona (safety manager? plant director?), factory size range, and industry verticals (automotive, pharma, electronics?)\n- **Competitive Landscape** — You name Visionify and Intenseye, but claim \"fastest time-to-value\" without proving competitors are slow/expensive. What DO they charge? What IS their deployment time?\n- **Risks & Mitigations** — Tech risks are addressed (domain gap, privacy), but no mention of sales risk (will factories actually pay?), deployment risk (terrible on-site networks?), or competitive pressure (price wars?)\n\n### ❌ **Missing/unclear:**\n- **Success Metrics** — No customer KPIs (e.g., \"reduce incidents by X%\", \"Y% violation detection in Z days\") or business KPIs (sales targets, churn, deployment speed targets). The readiness assessment is described but not quantified.\n- **Business Model** — This is the biggest gap. \"India-mid-market pricing\" appears once, but there's NO pricing structure (subscription? per-camera? per-site?), no hardware cost recovery plan (who pays for the expensive edge boxes?), and no monetization path after the free \"readiness assessment\" wedge.\n\n---\n\n## To get this council-ready, I need to ask about:\n\n**Business Model** (the council's commercial feasibility agents will flag this immediately):\n\nYou've built a compelling technical story, but **how does money work?**\n\n- What's the pricing model? (Subscription per site? Per camera? One-time + support contract?)\n- Who pays for the edge hardware? (You provide it? Customer buys it? Lease/rent?)\n- What happens after the free \"30-min readiness assessment\"? (Paid pilot? Annual contract? What's the conversion path?)\n- What's a realistic ACV (annual contract value) for a mid-sized factory with, say, 20 cameras?\n\nThe council will score this as \"incomplete\" without a clear answer to \"how do you make money and sustain the business?\"",
