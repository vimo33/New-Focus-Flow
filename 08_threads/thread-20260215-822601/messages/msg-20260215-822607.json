  "content": "Below is an **updated Concept + Vision doc** that bakes in the new transcript insights (setup ownership, need for an edge box, map vs zones, templates, training strategy, CV engineer role, differentiation). I’ve also **answered the open questions** with concrete solutions and a research-backed approach.\n\n---\n\n# Concept & Vision Doc — **KavachVision (working name)**\n\n**Tagline:** *Turn existing CCTV into an always-on safety officer — on-prem, low-bandwidth, audit-ready.*\n\n### Why I’m changing the name (lightly)\n\nYour earlier “Raksha” name is strong, but there’s a risk of confusion in the market because multiple safety-tech players use similar “protection” naming. This doc uses **KavachVision** as the working name (Kavach = shield). Keep “RakshaLens” as an internal codename if you like.\n\n---\n\n## 1) Product Vision\n\n**KavachVision** is an **edge-first workplace safety analytics platform** for Indian factories (starting Bangalore/Chennai) that:\n\n1. **Connects to existing IP cameras/NVRs**\n2. **Detects safety violations + unsafe acts** in near real time\n3. Produces **timestamped evidence clips + dashboards + weekly reports**\n4. Offers a **30-minute “Camera Readiness + Violation Baseline” assessment** as the sales wedge\n5. Improves accuracy over time via **site calibration + lightweight fine-tuning**, not “train from scratch for every client.”\n\nThe goal is to make safety monitoring **fast to deploy**, **reliable**, and **cheaper than adding humans to watch screens**.\n\n---\n\n## 2) The Customer Product Experience (updated from transcript)\n\n### 2.1 Setup ownership: Assisted → Self-Serve (joint process)\n\nTranscript insight: the first deployments should be **done together** (you + client), then gradually productize into self-serve.\n\n**Two modes**\n\n* **Assisted Setup (first 5–10 customers):** KavachVision team does onboarding with the customer remotely/in-person.\n* **Self-Serve Setup (later):** Customer can do 80% themselves; your team only helps for network constraints and policy tuning.\n\nThis is realistic and aligns with what top players do: edge deployments usually involve onboarding support early on.\n\n### 2.2 “Map” question: don’t overbuild — start with Zones\n\nYou don’t need a full plant map in MVP.\n\n**MVP approach**\n\n* Camera list shows thumbnails (auto-discovered)\n* For each camera, the user draws **polygons (zones/ROIs) directly on the camera view**\n* Optional: upload a floorplan image later and “pin cameras” for nicer UX\n\nThis answers “do we need a map?”: **No**, not initially. “Zones on video” is enough and much faster.\n\n### 2.3 Templates per camera / area (core differentiator)\n\nCustomers choose a **template** per camera (Machining, Welding, Assembly, Warehouse, Forklift Corridor, etc.). Each template preconfigures:\n\n* PPE rules (helmet/goggles/vest/shoes/gloves)\n* Alert severity (immediate vs daily digest)\n* Analytics FPS (higher for critical zones)\n* Evidence clip length\n\nThis “template-first” approach is a key speed advantage.\n\n---\n\n## 3) Deployment Architecture (edge-first is non-negotiable)\n\nTranscript insight: **you must deploy a local machine** (edge box), otherwise bandwidth blows up.\n\n### 3.1 Camera connectivity (standardized)\n\nUse **ONVIF Profile S** for discovery/control + RTSP for streaming. ([ONVIF][1])\n\n### 3.2 Edge box does the heavy lifting\n\n* Video stays **on-prem** for analytics\n* Cloud stores **events/metrics** and optionally **short evidence clips**\n* If internet drops, safety detection continues\n\nThis also matches how competitors message it: e.g., Visionify explicitly describes “deploy edge server” for on-site processing. ([Visionify AI Safety Solutions][2])\n\n### 3.3 Privacy-by-design\n\nOffer optional worker anonymization (blur/3D anonymization) for dashboards and exports; this is now table-stakes and explicitly marketed by Intenseye. ([intenseye.com][3])\n\n---\n\n## 4) The Big Open Question: Training per client vs “general model”\n\nYour CV engineer in the transcript is basically right:\n\n* Classic object detectors often need **site adaptation** to hit high accuracy in messy real CCTV.\n* But you don’t want “manual re-training per camera” like old-school vendors.\n\n### 4.1 Recommended approach: **Foundation → Calibration → Fine-tune (when needed)**\n\n**Layer A: Foundation models (pre-trained)**\n\n* Start with strong PPE/person detection baselines trained on public PPE datasets (helmet datasets are common; gloves/boots are harder). For helmets, SHWD is a known dataset. ([GitHub][4])\n* Add broader hard-hat datasets (e.g., annotated helmet/person/head). ([Kaggle][5])\n\n**Layer B: Site calibration (no model training yet)**\n\n* Camera angle, lighting, occlusion, PPE color, reflective vests, etc.\n* Use ROI polygons, per-zone rules, confidence thresholds, and multi-frame confirmation to reduce false alarms.\n\n**Layer C: Lightweight fine-tuning (only if the KPI demands it)**\n\n* When a site’s environment causes systematic errors, do **small-data fine-tuning** (transfer learning) on that site’s samples.\n* This is not “train everything again”; it’s targeted improvement.\n\n### 4.2 Where VLMs fit (the transcript’s “BLM/VLM changed CV” point)\n\nTreat VLMs (Vision-Language Models) as a **precision tool**, not your main engine:\n\n* Use them for **hard-to-model edge cases**, **new use-case prototyping**, and **labeling acceleration** (“is this person wearing goggles?”).\n* Run them **sparingly** (e.g., only on uncertain frames/events) because token/API costs can explode if you run VLMs on continuous streams.\n\nSo the product story becomes:\n\n> “Core detection runs locally with optimized CV models. VLMs act as an expert reviewer for ambiguous cases and rapid rollout of new rules.”\n\nThat’s how you get speed + accuracy without insane cost.\n\n---\n\n## 5) What is the Computer Vision Engineer’s role (so it’s not ‘manual forever’)\n\nTranscript insight: “If automated, what’s his role?”\n\n**Answer:** the CV engineer builds the **automation system**, not manual per-site projects.\n\nKey responsibilities:\n\n* Maintain and improve the **foundation PPE models**\n* Own the **evaluation harness** (precision/recall, false alarm budgets)\n* Build the **active learning loop** (sample → label → fine-tune → deploy)\n* Create new templates / detectors and push them as safe “model releases”\n* Handle the 10% weird sites where lighting/camera placement breaks everything\n\nSo: **automation-first**, with expert oversight.\n\n---\n\n## 6) Edge Hardware Tiers (updated + grounded)\n\nYou asked for 16 / 32 / 50 cameras. Here’s a spec tiering that’s realistic for 2–6MP cameras when you analyze at ~5–10 FPS (typical for PPE compliance). This also bakes in video decode reality.\n\n### Why GPU selection matters\n\nMulti-stream ingest is often limited by **hardware video decoding** as much as AI inference. The **NVIDIA L4** is a strong fit for video analytics and is commonly described as having **4 video decoders + 2 encoders**, which helps with many concurrent streams. ([Cisco][6])\nNVIDIA’s DeepStream documentation also includes performance guidance specifically for L4-class deployments. ([NVIDIA Docs][7])\n\n### **KavachEdge S — up to ~16 cameras**\n\n* **CPU:** 8–12 cores (server-grade preferred)\n* **RAM:** 32–64 GB\n* **GPU:** 1× NVIDIA L4 (recommended) or similar inference + decode capable GPU\n* **Storage:** 1–2 TB NVMe (events/clips) + optional SATA SSD/HDD for retention\n* **Network:** dual 1GbE (2.5GbE preferred)\n\n### **KavachEdge M — up to ~32 cameras**\n\n* **CPU:** 12–16 cores\n* **RAM:** 64–128 GB\n* **GPU:** 1× NVIDIA L4 (24GB) (or 2× smaller GPUs depending on supply)\n* **Storage:** 2 TB NVMe + 4–8 TB retention tier\n* **Network:** 10GbE preferred (or bonded 1GbE)\n\n### **KavachEdge L — up to ~50 cameras**\n\n* **CPU:** 16–24 cores\n* **RAM:** 128 GB\n* **GPU:** 2× NVIDIA L4 (recommended for stable latency + headroom)\n* **Storage:** 2–4 TB NVMe + 8–16 TB retention tier\n* **Network:** 10GbE strongly recommended\n\n**Important packaging sentence (put this in the doc):**\n\n> “Camera capacity assumes 1080p/2–6MP streams and analytics sampling at ~5–10 FPS for PPE; higher FPS, more detectors, or heavier models may reduce per-box capacity.”\n\n---\n\n## 7) Packaging the “30-minute readiness + baseline” into the product\n\nThis is a killer GTM wedge from your transcript.\n\n### The Assessment (standardized deliverable)\n\n**Input:** 30 minutes access to camera previews + 24–72 hours of sample footage (or a short live window + NVR access)\n**Output:**\n\n* Camera quality score per feed (lighting, angle, occlusion)\n* “Detectability” score per PPE rule (helmet easy, gloves harder)\n* Top 10 violation moments with evidence clips\n* Upgrade recommendations (“3 cameras need repositioning; 2 need upgrade”)\n* ROI estimate: hours saved + expected violation reduction\n\n**Why it works:** It converts the sale from “trust me bro AI” into “here’s your plant’s own baseline proof.”\n\n---\n\n## 8) Compliance note for India (DPDP Rules)\n\nIf you operate in India, your concept should explicitly commit to:\n\n* Minimize data movement (edge-first)\n* Role-based access, retention controls, audit logs\n* Clear purpose limitation (safety), not productivity surveillance\n\nIndia has notified **DPDP Rules, 2025** to operationalize the DPDP Act, 2023. ([Press Information Bureau][8])\n(You don’t need to put legal details in the vision doc—just commit to the principles and edge-first architecture.)\n\n---\n\n# Open Questions → Research-backed Solutions (from transcript)\n\n1. **Who does setup — customer or us?**\n   **Solution:** Assisted Setup for first 5–10 customers; then Self-Serve with guided templates + remote co-pilot.\n\n2. **Do we need a plant map?**\n   **Solution:** MVP uses zones drawn on video. Floorplan upload is Phase 2 UX polish.\n\n3. **Do we need a local machine?**\n   **Solution:** Yes. Edge box is mandatory for bandwidth + privacy + reliability.\n\n4. **Do we train per client?**\n   **Solution:** Foundation model + site calibration; fine-tune only when KPI requires. Use public PPE datasets to bootstrap; collect “real CCTV” from pilots to close the domain gap. ([GitHub][4])\n\n5. **How is this different from existing companies?**\n   **Solution:** Differentiation is **deployment speed + automated onboarding + readiness assessment** + India-mid-market pricing. Competitors emphasize edge safety analytics too, so your wedge must be “fastest time-to-value.” ([Visionify AI Safety Solutions][2])\n\n6. **What’s the CV engineer role if automation improves?**\n   **Solution:** He builds the automation pipeline, evaluation harness, and active learning loop; not manual per-camera work.\n\n---\n\n## Roadmap (tight and credible)\n\n**Phase 1 (MVP, 8–12 weeks)**\n\n* ONVIF discovery + RTSP ingest\n* PPE templates (helmet/goggles/vest/shoes) + zones\n* Evidence clips + dashboard + weekly reports\n* Edge box packaging (S/M) + readiness assessment kit\n\n**Phase 2 (12–20 weeks)**\n\n* Active learning loop + lightweight fine-tuning pipeline\n* Anonymization options\n* Multi-site rollups\n* Alert routing rules (WhatsApp/email) + SLA reporting\n\n**Phase 3**\n\n* More complex unsafe-act detection (forklift, proximity, guarding)\n* Integrations (EHS systems)\n* Predictive insights (only after stable event history)\n\n---\n\nIf you want a next step that will seriously help execution: convert this into a **1-page PRD summary + a SpecKit-ready feature list** (Onboarding, Camera discovery, Templates, Edge pipeline, Events/Clips store, Dashboard/Reports, Model lifecycle). That makes it immediately buildable without turning into a research essay.\n\n[1]: https://www.onvif.org/profiles/profile-s/?utm_source=chatgpt.com \"Profile S - ONVIF\"\n[2]: https://visionify.ai/?utm_source=chatgpt.com \"Visionify | AI-Powered Workplace Safety\"\n[3]: https://www.intenseye.com/data-privacy?utm_source=chatgpt.com \"Data privacy & security\"\n[4]: https://github.com/njvisionpower/Safety-Helmet-Wearing-Dataset?utm_source=chatgpt.com \"Safety helmet wearing detect dataset, with pretrained model\"\n[5]: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/hard-hat-detection?utm_source=chatgpt.com \"Safety Helmet Detection\"\n[6]: https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en/us/products/collateral/servers-unified-computing/ucs-c-series-rack-servers/nvidia-l4-gpu.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com \"NVIDIA L4 Tensor Core GPU - Cisco\"\n[7]: https://docs.nvidia.com/metropolis/deepstream/6.3/dev-guide/text/DS_Performance.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com \"Performance — DeepStream 6.3 Release documentation\"\n[8]: https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2190655&utm_source=chatgpt.com \"Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Rules, 2025\"",
