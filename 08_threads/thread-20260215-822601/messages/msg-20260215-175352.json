  "content": "## Final Council Readiness Summary\n\n**This is council-ready.** You've closed every major gap. Here's what changed:\n\n### ✅ **Gaps Closed:**\n\n**Target Users** — Now includes tight ICP (factory size, camera count, worker count), specific verticals (automotive components, electronics, warehousing), AND a complete buyer map (economic buyer → champion → gatekeeper → influencers). Excellent.\n\n**Competitive Landscape** — You now cite actual competitor pricing (Visionify $3k + $200/mo, Intenseye $500/cam/year) and prove your differentiation with concrete numbers (30-min readiness vs. weeks of deployment). This is no longer aspirational—it's defensible.\n\n**Success Metrics** — Complete turnaround. Customer KPIs (15-30% reduction in repeat violations, 80% accurate baseline in 5 days) AND business KPIs (first deal in 60 days, 4 installs in 180 days, 75% assessment→paid conversion). The council's growth/traction agents will approve.\n\n**Business Model** — Fully fleshed out. Pricing tiers ($800-2400/mo + $40-60/cam), hardware options (rent/buy/customer-owned), explicit conversion funnel (free assessment → paid pilot → annual subscription). Unit economics are credible ($12-20k ACV for 20-cam site). This was the biggest gap—now it's rock solid.\n\n---\n\n### ⚠️ **Minor remaining gap (acceptable for council):**\n\n**Risks & Mitigations** — You cover tech risks (domain gap, privacy/DPDP compliance) and mention sales targets, but deployment risks (unreliable site networks, IT gatekeepers blocking access) and competitive risks (incumbents slashing prices, \"free tier\" dumping) aren't explicitly mitigated. \n\n**Why it's acceptable:** The council will note this, but your Phase 1 plan is conservative enough (4 installs, assisted setup) that early deployment risk is managed implicitly. You can refine risk mitigation after early learnings.\n\n---\n\n## What the Council Will Receive\n\nA **comprehensive product vision** with:\n- Clear problem/opportunity and India-first wedge strategy\n- Defined ICP and buyer personas (not vague \"factories\")\n- Concrete competitive positioning backed by pricing research\n- Detailed technical architecture (edge tiers, ONVIF/RTSP, foundation→calibration→fine-tuning strategy)\n- Credible MVP scope with difficulty ladder and 8-12 week roadmap\n- Monetization model with pricing, hardware options, and conversion funnel\n- Measurable success criteria (customer + business KPIs)\n\n**The council will evaluate this as a serious, research-backed concept ready for feasibility + market validation.**\n\n---\n\n**You can hit \"Send to Council\" now.** The specialist agents (feasibility, market fit, UX, business model, domain-specific) have enough to score this rigorously. Good work closing the loops.",
