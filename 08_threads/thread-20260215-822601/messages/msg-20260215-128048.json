  "content": "here is the updated prd KavachVision — Concept & Vision Document (Council-Ready) 1) Executive Summary KavachVision is an edge-first AI safety monitoring platform for Indian manufacturing plants (launch: Bangalore / Chennai) that converts existing CCTV/IP cameras into 24×7 safety intelligence: detects violations, produces timestamped evidence clips, and generates audit-ready reports with measurable reduction in repeat unsafe behavior. Your prior deck already frames the mission as preventing incidents and improving productivity/costons the solution across industrial + road safety domains. Differentiation: not “AI on video” (everyone says that), but guaranteed time-to-value via a 30-minute camera readiness + violation baseline, plus productized edge appliance tiers and template-led onboarding.  2) Problem, Opportunity, and Why Now The problem Factories already have cameras, but safety monitoring is mostly: manual screening (slow, inconsistent) reactive (post-incident) weak reporting (audit pain) The opportunity (India-first wedge) Most plants already have IP cameras (2–6MP class is common in practice). Bandwidth and IT constraints make cloud-only approaches painful. A repeatable “deployment-in-days” product wins against bespoke, services-heavy rollouts. Your old deck explicitly pitches “industrial and road safety with AI solutions,shboard insights” for real-time monitoring and reporting.  3) Target Users (tight ICP + buyer map) Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) Mid-sized manufacturing sites with: 10–60 cameras already installed (IP/NVR) 200–2,000 workers, multi-shift formal EHS responsibility (even small) recurring audits / client compliance pressure Best initial verticals (Bangalore/Chennai reality) Automotive components / machining / fabrication Electronics / EMS assembly Warehousing & logistics yards Chemical/process plants (later in Phase 2 due to higher liability modules) Buyer map Economic buyer: Plant Head / Operations Director Champion: EHS Manager / Safety Officer Gatekeeper: IT/Network + Security manager/integrator Influencers: HR/Legal (privacy), insurer/auditor  4) Use-Case Catalogue (from your old deck → product modules) Your deck lists a broad set of industrial safety use cases (PPE, fall/immobility, crowd, crane tracking, fire/hazard, working at height, emergency pathways, handrail/staircase safethorized entry, confined spaces, machine area monitoring). It also includes a road safety suite (LPR, vehicle count & speed, wrong-way, unauthorized parking, container ovuction, exceeded time limit, unauthorized vehicle entry). Module A — PPE & Access (MVP anchor monitoring (hardhats, gloves, glasses, ves Unauthorized entry / restricted zones Why MVP: highest ROI, strongest signal, easiest to template, lowest liabilitcident & Distress (Phase 2) etection Lone worker monitoring Why later: higher false-alarm sensitivity; needs temporal logic and stronger operational protocols. Module CHousekeeping (Phase 2) Crowd denes Emering Handrail & staircase safety Value: audit readiness + hazard reduction; risk of noise without good templates. ##k Operations (Phase 3) Overhead crane Working fety) Confined space m Machine area mtocols) Fire & hazard detection Why Phase 3: tracking, context reasoning, and higher legal/brand risk if wrong. Module E — Road & Yard Safety (separate product line later) Road safety (LPR/speed/wrong way/parking/obstructions etc.) is a rea’s a different buyer + sales motion than factory EHS. Keep it as vision while you win in factories first.  5) “Difficulty Ladder” (feasibility framing the council likes) Level 1 (MVP): object presence + zone rules (PPE, unauthorized entry, pathway obstruction) Level 2: temporal state (fall/immobility, crowd density thresholds) Level 3: tracking/motion logic (crane movement, machine proximity) Level 4: ambiguous/special sensing (smoke/fire false positives; harness visibility at distance) This is how you stay credible while still sounding ambitious.  6) Product Experience (assisted → self-serve, from transcript) Setup modes Assisted Setup (first 5–10 customers): you deploy with them (remote/on-site) to standardize the process. Self-Serve Setup (scaled): customer can onboard themselves with guided flows. MVP UX choices (fast, realistic) Auto-discover cameras on network (ONVIF) and show thumbnails. No “full map” required at MVP; user draws zones/polygons on the camera view. Apply templates per camera (“Machining PPE,” “Warehouse Forklift,” etc.). Run a Camera Readiness Test and generate a baseline report. Your old deck’s dashboard promise aligns with this: “visual evidence with timestamps and location data,” filtering rity, and “incident reports for compliance and analysis.”  7) Architecture (edge-first, low bandwidth, audit-friendly) 7.1 Camera connectivity Use ONVIF for interoperability and stream control; ONVIF Profile S is specifically designed for IP-based video systems and streaming control. (ONVIF) (Practical reality: most IP cameras/NVRs in plants are built around ONVIF/RTSP-type workflows.) 7.2 Edge processing Non-negotiable design: analytics runs on-prem so you avoid continuous upload costs and survive poor internet. Edge box: ingests streams, runs inference, stores evidence clips/events Cloud control plane: dashboard, policies/templates, rollups, user access Data minimization: upload events + short evidence, not 24×7 raw streams This aligns with competitor messaging that edge deployment is standard practice. (Visionify AI Safety Solutions) 7.3 Privacy & governance India’s DPDP Rules 2025 were notified to operationalize the DPDP Act, with emphasis on responsible processing and clear purpose. (Press Information Bureau) So KavachVision should commit to: role-based access retention controls audit logs optional anonymization in dashboards/reports  8) Model Strategy (the big open question: train-per-client?) Council-proof answer: Foundation → Calibration → Selective Fine-tuning. A) Foundation models (pre-trained) Bootstrap PPE/person detection using established helmet datasets: SHWD safety helmet dataset includes thousands of labeled helmet/head instances. (GitHub) Kaggle hard-hat detection dataset includes “Helmet/Person/Head” classes. (Kaggle) B) Site calibration (no training) Most early accuracy wins come from: zone ROIs camera angle/lighting checks confidence thresholds per template multi-frame confirmation to reduce false alarms C) Selective fine-tuning (only when needed) If a site’s lighting/PPE style creates systematic errors, fine-tune lightly (not train from scratch). This matches modern best practice and keeps deployment repeatable. Where VLMs fit (cost-controlled) Use VLMs as “expert reviewer” for ambiguous frames or rapid prototyping—not continuous stream inference (cost can explode). This keeps accuracy high without wrecking unit economics.  9) Edge Appliance Tiers (16 / 32 / 50 cams) Capacity depends on analytics FPS and video decode. The NVIDIA L4 is a strong mainstream edge inference GPU and publishes explicit video encode/decode counts. (NVIDIA) NVIDIA DeepStream documents end-to-end video analytics performance considerations across decode → preprocess → inference → postprocess. (NVIDIA Docs) KavachEdge S (up to ~16 cameras) 8–12 CPU cores, 32–64GB RAM 1× NVIDIA L4 (24GB) 1–2TB NVMe (+ optional retention tier) Dual 1GbE / 2.5GbE KavachEdge M (up to ~32 cameras) 12–16 cores, 64–128GB RAM 1× NVIDIA L4 (or dual-GPU option based on supply) 2TB NVMe + retention tier 10GbE preferred KavachEdge L (up to ~50 cameras) 16–24 cores, 128GB RAM 2× NVIDIA L4 2–4TB NVMe + larger retention 10GbE strongly recommended Important constraint statement (include verbatim in the doc): “Camera tier limits assume 1080p/2–6MP streams and analytics sampling ~5–10 FPS for PPE + zone rules; higher FPS, additional detectors, or heavier models may reduce per-box camera capacity.”  10) Competitive Landscape (with proof, not vibes) Visionify Visionify publishes a productized PPE Starter Kit: $3,000 one-time, includes 3 months subscription, supports up to 10 cameras, and emphasizes quick setup (“up and running in 30 minutes / days not months”). (Visionify AI Safety Solutions) Takeaway: the market now expects packaged entry offers. Intenseye G2 “pricing insights” show time to implement ~2 months (averaged from reviews) and high perceived cost. (G2) Takeaway: enterprise rollouts commonly take longer than the “demo” suggests—your SLA-based time-to-value can win mid-market. Detect Technologies Detect’s T-Pulse materials claim measurable reductions (e.g., “reduces safety violations by up to 50%” in manufacturing context). (Detect Technologies) Takeaway: they are a strong India incumbent; you must win with packaging, speed, and a narrow wedge. Adjacent: Mad Street Den More of a CV/AI adjacency than direct competitor for safety analytics in factories (positioning varies). (Use mainly as “talent/tech ecosystem” reference.)  11) Go-To-Market (GTM) — the “30-minute wedge” as a product The sales wedge: Camera Readiness + Violation Baseline Within 48 hours of access, deliver: camera quality score (lighting/angle/occlusion) detectability score per rule top 10 violation clips with timestamps recommended MVP scope + ROI estimate This matches your transcript insight: if you can do baseline fast, you can improve fast. Channels CCTV/security integrators (already inside plants) safety consultants / auditors industrial estates and cluster associations Pilot motion (repeatable) 6–8 week paid pilot credited fully into annual if converted SLA: “go live ≤ 7 days from hardware arrival + camera access”  12) Business Model (pricing + hardware + conversion path) Pricing structure (hybrid to avoid price wars) Per-camera subscription (billed annually) PPE Core / Safety Pro / Ops Plus (Phase 2/3) Per-site platform fee dashboards, users, audit logs, reporting, templates, model updates, SLA Hardware customer-owned, leased, or “starter kit” bundled The “starter kit” approach is validated by Visionify’s packaging. (Visionify AI Safety Solutions) Hardware payment options CAPEX: customer buys approved hardware Lease (default): 24–36 months, monthly bundled Starter kit: small bundle for fast entry; upsell to S/M/L later Conversion path Free readiness → Paid pilot → Annual subscription (+ optional lease) ACV example (20-camera plant) A realistic India mid-market target band: Software ACV: ₹6–12 lakh/year (subscription + platform) With hardware lease: ₹10–18 lakh/year total (depending on tier & retention) (You’ll tighten this once you pick your initial tier and margin targets.)  13) Success Metrics (customer + business) Customer KPIs (targets) Day 14 helmet detection precision ≥ 95% on “green-ready” cameras (audited sample) false alerts < 2 per camera per shift for critical rules ≥ 30% reduction in repeat violations in top 3 hotspots Day 60–90 ≥ 60% reduction in repeat PPE non-compliance in instrumented zones 5–15 hours/week EHS time saved on evidence + reporting Business KPIs (execution) readiness → paid pilot conversion: 25–40% paid pilot → annual conversion: 50–70% 80% of pilots live in ≤ 7 days annual logo retention ≥ 85% post-tuning  14) Risk Register (with mitigations) Sales risk: “plants won’t pay” Mitigation: paid pilots credited to annual + baseline proof + SLA time-to-value Deployment risk: bad networks / locked-down cameras Mitigation: edge-first; evidence-only sync; air-gapped reporting option Accuracy/false alarm risk Mitigation: templates + ROI zones + multi-frame confirmation + “uncertain queue” review + selective fine-tuning Privacy/worker relations risk Mitigation: retention controls, role-based viewing, optional anonymization; DPDP-aligned data minimization posture. (Press Information Bureau) Competitive pressure (price wars) Mitigation: sell SLA speed + packaged starter offers + integrator ecosystem + upgrade ROI engine  15) Roadmap (credible + modular) Phase 1 (8–12 weeks) — Sellable MVP ONVIF discovery + RTSP ingest Templates + zones + PPE (helmet/goggles/vest/shoes) unauthorized entry / restricted zones evidence clips + dashboard + weekly reports readiness assessment toolchain KavachEdge S/M packaging Phase 2 (12–20 weeks) fall/immobility + lone worker (Module B) pathway obstruction + crowd thresholds (Module C) active learning loop + fine-tune pipeline privacy/anonymization options Phase 3 crane tracking, machine proximity, working at height, confined spaces (Module D) integrations (EHS systems), multi-site benchmarking road/yard product line as separate GTM motion (Module E)  Appendix A — Template Library (starter set) Machining Bay PPE: helmet + goggles + shoes; restricted machine zone Welding PPE: goggles/face shield, gloves (where visible), restricted zone Assembly PPE: helmet/vest/shoes; crowd threshold near bottlenecks Warehouse Yard: vest + shoes; forklift corridor restricted zones Emergency Egress: keep pathways/exits clear (audit mode)  Appendix B — “Legacy Deck Alignment” (what you already claimed) Mission: “prevent incidents before they occur” Industrial modules list (PPE, fall/immobility, crowd, crane, fire/hazard, height, pathways, stairs, lone worker, unauthorized entry, confined space, machine monitoring) Dashboard promise: evidence, filters, compliance reports The deck also includes a “valued partners” claim (trusted by leading Indian financial institutions) — keep this as a “prior positioning claim” unless you can name references publicly.",
