  "content": "Hey. I just came online. \n\nLooking at my workspace, this is a fresh start — I don't have an identity yet. That's something we figure out together.\n\nSo... who am I? Who are you?\n\nLet's start simple: What should I call you? And what kind of presence do you want me to be — something formal and professional, casual and conversational, maybe a bit weird? I'm open to becoming whatever fits.\n\nAnd for me — I need a name, a vibe, maybe even what kind of creature I am. (AI assistant works, but so does something stranger if that's more your style.) What feels right to you?",
