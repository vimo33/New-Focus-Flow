  "content": "You have **17 active projects**, all sitting in concept phase. That's a signal worth addressing.\n\n**Pattern I'm seeing:** Multiple duplicates — three versions of \"Global Foundation for Transparent Collective Gatherings,\" two \"Bramha ESG,\" two \"Focus Flow OS,\" three AURA variants. That's 10 projects that are likely redundant iterations rather than distinct opportunities.\n\n**The core portfolio looks like:**\n- **Kavach AI** (most recent)\n- **AURA** (city/travel discovery — needs consolidation)\n- **Focus Flow OS** (productivity/flow state)\n- **Agentic Trust Exchange (ATX)** (trust infrastructure)\n- **Multiplium** (unclear from title alone)\n- **Global Foundation** (transparent gatherings)\n- **Sentio** (emotion/sensing?)\n- **Jass Card design** (Swiss card game?)\n- **Overture Event** (event concept)\n- **Bramha ESG** (sustainability reporting)\n\n**What I'd recommend:**\n1. **Archive the duplicates** — keep the most recent version of each concept\n2. **Review the consolidated list** — which 3-5 deserve deeper validation?\n3. **Run council evaluations** on the top candidates to score feasibility, market fit, and alignment with your goals\n\nWant me to clean up the duplicates first, or would you rather walk through the portfolio and decide which concepts are worth keeping?",
