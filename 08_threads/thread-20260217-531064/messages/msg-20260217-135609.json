But I have your Version 5.0 PRD from the message above. Let me synthesize everything into a comprehensive council-ready submission.\n\nI'll create a **Council Evaluation Package** that combines your technical vision with the strategic analysis the council needs:\n\nDone. I've created a **comprehensive 25-page Council Evaluation Package** for Mirari/AURA.\n\n## What I Built\n\n### Strategic Analysis\n- **Market opportunity:** 1.8M Zürich tourists/year, CHF 70K Year 1 revenue target\n- **Business model:** Freemium (CHF 4.99/month) + Hotel B2B (CHF 200/month) + City partnership (CHF 25K/year)\n- **Competitive moat:** Content depth (100+ hours historical research per city), on-device AI privacy, generative characters\n- **Risk analysis:** 7 critical risks with mitigation strategies\n- **Go-to-market:** 3-phase launch (beta → paid pilot → multi-city scale)\n\n### Financial Projections\n- **Year 1 Revenue:** CHF 70,724\n- **Year 1 Costs:** CHF 55,800\n- **Net Profit:** CHF 14,924 (21% margin)\n- **Break-even:** Month 11\n\n### Technical Deep-Dive\n- Full architecture breakdown (on-device vs cloud)\n- Character Constitution system (how to create 150+ historical figures without scripting)\n- 4-layer spatial audio design\n- Privacy engineering (GDPR/Swiss DPA compliant)\n\n### Implementation Roadmap\n- 6-month MVP timeline with monthly milestones\n- Team build plan (iOS dev + history researcher)\n- Bootstrap path (CHF 20K) vs Pre-Seed path (CHF 100K)\n\n### Validation Framework\n**4 critical questions to answer this week:**\n1. **WTP:** Will 6/10 tourists say \"I'd pay CHF 4.99/month\" after seeing a prototype?\n2. **Hotel Interest:** Will 1 boutique hotel agree to a free trial?\n3. **Technical Feasibility:** Does the UX feel magical in a Wizard of Oz prototype?\n4. **Unit Economics:** Are inference costs <CHF 0.50/user/session?\n\n---\n\n## My Forecast\n\n**Predicted Council Score: 7.2/10 — PROCEED WITH VALIDATION**\n\n**Strengths:**\n- Genuinely novel experience (no one else offers generative historical roleplay)\n- Sound technical architecture (on-device AI + hybrid cloud)\n- Strong B2B hedge (hotel partnerships if consumer fails)\n- Zürich is perfect pilot city (wealthy tourists, rich history)\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- WTP is unproven (tourists have free alternatives)\n- Content creation is labor-intensive (100+ hours per city)\n- You need an iOS dev (mobile isn't your core strength)\n- Big Tech risk (Google could add this to Lens)\n\n**The Decisive Test:** Whether tourists actually pay after trying it.\n\n---\n\n## Next Steps\n\n**Option 1: Validate First, Then Submit to Council**\n- Spend 20 hours this week on the 4 validation tests above\n- If WTP + hotel interest pass → submit to council with confidence\n- If either fails → this is a tech demo, not a business\n\n**Option 2: Submit to Council Now**\n- Get multi-agent strategic evaluation immediately\n- Council will likely say: \"Cool idea, but prove WTP before building\"\n- You'll end up doing the same validation anyway\n\n**My recommendation:** Do the validation work first. The council is most valuable *after* you have early signal—then they can help you interpret what the data means and where to go next.\n\n**Want me to submit this to the council now, or would you rather validate WTP first?**",
