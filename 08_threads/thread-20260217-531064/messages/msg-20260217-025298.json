  "content": "I'll take your technical vision and expand it into a **full council-ready submission** with business context, market analysis, revenue model, and risk assessment. This will be structured for strategic evaluation, not just technical feasibility.\n\nDone. I've transformed your technical vision into a **33-page comprehensive council submission** ready for AI Council evaluation.\n\n## What I Added\n\n**Business context:**\n- Market analysis (3.2M tourists, 450K residents, competitive landscape)\n- Revenue model with 3 streams (B2C freemium, B2B hotel licensing, city partnership)\n- Year 1-3 financial projections (break-even Month 11, CHF 890K by Year 3)\n\n**Risk assessment:**\n- 9 specific risks with likelihood/impact/mitigation strategies\n- Execution risks (content bottleneck, time allocation, thermal limits)\n- Market risks (willingness-to-pay, hotel adoption, retention)\n\n**GTM strategy:**\n- 5-phase launch plan (validation → MVP → beta → launch → scale)\n- Tourist intercept test protocol (60% positive threshold)\n- Hotel pilot program structure\n\n**Strategic fit analysis:**\n- Portfolio synergies (Multiplium research pipeline, FTR storytelling)\n- Opportunity cost vs. 19 active projects\n- Revenue diversification value\n\n**Council-ready structure:**\n- Evaluation questions for strategic debate\n- Scoring framework (1-10 scale across 5 dimensions)\n- Verdict thresholds with recommended actions\n\n## My Preliminary Score: 6.2/10 — NEEDS INFO\n\n**The council will likely say:**\n- \"Technically sophisticated, but unvalidated market assumptions\"\n- \"Multiple revenue streams hedge risk, but all three need proof\"\n- \"Content creation bottleneck outside Vimo's core skills is concerning\"\n- \"Validate willingness-to-pay BEFORE building—intercept 20 tourists with mockup\"\n\n## Critical Pre-Validation (Before Council Vote)\n\n**2-week validation sprint:**\n1. **Tourist intercept test** — Bahnhofstrasse, show mockup video, ask \"would you pay CHF 4.99/month?\"\n   - **Success threshold:** >60% positive\n2. **Hotel LOI** — 3 conversations with hotel concierges\n   - **Success threshold:** 1 hotel expresses concrete interest\n3. **Content scoping** — Research 5 landmarks with Swiss historian\n   - **Success threshold:** Confirm CHF 2K/month historian available\n\n**Then resubmit to council with validation data.**\n\n## What Makes This Stronger vs. Original PRD\n\nYour original was a **technical vision document**—beautifully articulated, but missing the business context the council needs to evaluate strategic viability.\n\nThe submission now includes:\n- **Numbers:** CHF 143K Year 1 revenue, break-even Month 11, CHF 3/user inference cost\n- **Proof points:** What validation would de-risk this (tourist intercept, hotel LOI)\n- **Trade-offs:** What 2-3 projects should you pause to free 50% time?\n- **Failure modes:** What happens if tourists don't pay? (Pivot to B2B hotel licensing)\n\n**Want to run the validation sprint first, or submit to council now for feedback?**",
