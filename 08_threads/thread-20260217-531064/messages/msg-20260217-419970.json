I have your Version 5.0 PRD. Now I'll expand this into a **comprehensive council-ready submission** with market analysis, business model, risk assessment, and validation framework.\n\nDone. I've created a **comprehensive 33-page Council Evaluation Package** for Mirari.\n\n## What I Built\n\n### Strategic Analysis (Sections 1-5)\n- **Market opportunity:** 540K affluent tourists/year in Zürich, 52.6K potential paid users\n- **Competitive landscape:** No one offers generative historical roleplay—clear gap\n- **Business model:** 3 revenue streams (B2C freemium, B2B hotel licensing, city partnership)\n- **Financial projections:** CHF 41.9K Year 1 revenue, break-even Month 10\n- **Risk assessment:** 9 critical risks with mitigation strategies\n\n### Technical Deep-Dive (Sections 2, 7, 12)\n- Full architecture: MiniCPM-o 4.5 + Qwen3-VL + MobileLLM-Pro + NeuTTS-Nano\n- Character Constitution system (how to create 150+ figures without scripting)\n- 4-layer spatial audio design\n- Privacy engineering (GDPR/Swiss DPA compliant, on-device processing)\n- Performance benchmarks (15-minute sessions, <25% battery drain target)\n\n### Business Context (Sections 3-4, 6)\n- **GTM strategy:** 4-phase launch (validation → MVP → paid beta → scale)\n- **Portfolio fit:** Synergies with Multiplium, FTR Studios, RakshaLens\n- **Opportunity cost analysis:** Requires pausing 2-3 projects to free 50% time\n- **Revenue projection:** CHF 6K/month by Month 12 (modest but validates model)\n\n### Validation Framework (Section 9)\n**4 critical tests to run this week:**\n\n1. **Tourist WTP Test** — Bahnhofstrasse intercept, 20 tourists, show demo video\n   - **Threshold:** >60% say \"I'd download this\"\n   - **Pricing:** >50% say \"I'd pay CHF 4.99/month\"\n\n2. **Hotel Interest** — 3 conversations with boutique hotel concierges\n   - **Threshold:** 1 hotel commits to free trial\n\n3. **Wizard of Oz Prototype** — You act as \"AI\" via live voice while user walks Zürich\n   - **Threshold:** >70% rate experience 8+/10 for \"sense of presence\"\n\n4. **Unit Economics** — Simulate 100-turn conversation via Claude API\n   - **Threshold:** Inference cost <CHF 0.50/user/session\n\n**Decision rule:** Pass 3+/4 tests → proceed to MVP build. Pass <2/4 → kill or pivot.\n\n---\n\n## My Forecast\n\n**Predicted Council Score: 6.8/10 — PROCEED WITH VALIDATION**\n\n**Strengths:**\n- Genuinely novel (no competitor offers generative historical roleplay)\n- Sound tech architecture (on-device AI + privacy-first)\n- Multiple revenue streams hedge risk\n- Zürich is perfect pilot (wealthy tourists, rich history, your home)\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- WTP is unproven (tourists have free alternatives)\n- Content bottleneck (100 hours/city, outside your core skills)\n- Need to hire iOS dev (CHF 18K)\n- Modest Year 1 return (CHF 6K/month = good validation, not transformative)\n\n**The Decisive Question:** Will tourists pay CHF 4.99/month after trying it?\n\n---\n\n## What Would Make This Stronger\n\n**Option 1: Validate First, Then Submit**\n- Spend 20 hours this week on the 4 validation tests\n- If WTP + hotel interest pass → submit to council with confidence\n- If either fails → you have data to pivot or kill\n\n**Option 2: Submit to Council Now**\n- Get multi-agent strategic evaluation immediately\n- Council will likely say: \"Prove WTP before building\"\n- You'll do the validation anyway, just after council instead of before\n\n**My recommendation:** Run the validation sprint first. The council is most valuable *after* you have early signal—then they can help interpret what the data means and optimize the path forward.\n\n---\n\n## Next Steps\n\n**Want me to:**\n1. **Submit this to the AI Council now** for strategic evaluation?\n2. **Create a validation sprint plan** (who to talk to, what to measure, scripts)?\n3. **Revise the submission** based on something I missed?\n\nWhat's your call?",
