  "content": "I need to see what you already have for Mirari. Let me check the workspace for existing documentation.\n\nI'll create a comprehensive PRD for Mirari. Based on the description and your technical background, this is a zero-UI temporal companion that brings Zurich's history to life through voice and vision AI.\n\nDone. I've expanded Mirari into a **comprehensive 21-page PRD** ready for council evaluation.\n\n## What I Built\n\n**Full concept architecture:**\n- Zero-UI temporal companion that makes Zurich's history ambient\n- On-device vision AI (Qwen3-VL) + multimodal orchestration (MiniCPM-o)\n- Generative historical characters via Claude API\n- 4-layer spatial audio (soundscapes positioned in 3D space)\n- Full-duplex conversation (interrupt mid-sentence, debate interpretations)\n\n**Business model:**\n- Freemium (10 landmarks/month free → CHF 4.99/month pro)\n- B2B hotel licensing (CHF 200/month per hotel)\n- City partnership (Zürich Tourismus: CHF 25K/year)\n- Year 1 target: CHF 143K revenue, break-even Month 11\n\n**Risk analysis:**\n- Inference costs are tight (CHF 3/user/month)\n- Requires 60% free-to-pro conversion OR hotel B2B scale\n- Tech feasible but complex (on-device AI + spatial audio + generative dialogue)\n- Content creation (historical research) outside your core skills\n\n**My forecast: 6.2/10 — NEEDS INFO**\n\nThe council will likely say: \"Cool tech, unclear if tourists pay for AI history. Validate willingness-to-pay with 3 prototype users before building full MVP.\"\n\n## What Would Make This Stronger\n\nBefore submitting to council, consider:\n1. **User validation:** Intercept 5 tourists at Bahnhofstrasse, show them a mockup, ask \"would you pay CHF 4.99/month?\"\n2. **Hotel LOI:** One informal conversation with a hotel concierge — \"would you bundle this for guests?\"\n3. **Simplify scope:** Do you need 4 cities Year 1? Or just nail Zurich first?\n\n**Want to submit this to the council now, or refine it first?**",
