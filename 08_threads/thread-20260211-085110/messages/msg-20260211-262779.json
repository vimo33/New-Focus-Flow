  "content": "I can see you've mapped out the full journey — and the sequencing logic makes sense on paper.\n\nBut here's what I'm noticing: you've just described four different products with four different value propositions, bundled together. That's not an MVP, it's a productized service business that happens to use AI tools.\n\nLet me ask this more directly:\n\n**If you could only build ONE of those four things — gap analysis, materiality assessment, KPI dashboard, or report generator — and had to charge for it as a standalone product that an SME would buy without the others, which one would actually get purchased?**\n\nBecause right now, your answer suggests the real insight might be: *\"SMEs don't want software, they want the whole problem solved for them\"* — which would mean this is fundamentally a consulting/service business with AI efficiency gains, not a SaaS platform.\n\nIs that the actual model here?",
