  "content": "Perfect — that's exactly the kind of strategic fork where outside perspectives help.\n\nAnd I think we've explored the concept enough that it's ready for a structured evaluation. You've got:\n\n✅ Clear problem space (ESG compliance pain for Swiss SMEs)  \n✅ Defined target users (50K indirect-pressure companies, pricing gap vs esg2go/Sweep)  \n✅ Solution approach (AI-powered tools with Swiss regulatory focus)  \n✅ Technical architecture (detailed stack with cost projections)  \n✅ **Strategic tension**: SaaS platform vs. productized service vs. hybrid\n\n**This is ready for the council.**\n\nI can send this concept to the AI evaluation panel — specialists in technical feasibility, business strategy, market analysis, ROI modeling, architecture, and UX. They'll give you structured feedback on:\n\n- Which business model (SaaS / service / hybrid) fits the market opportunity better\n- Whether the technical architecture supports both paths or needs different approaches\n- What the economics look like under each model\n- Which path is more defensible long-term\n- What the MVP should actually be\n\nWant me to kick off the council review?",
