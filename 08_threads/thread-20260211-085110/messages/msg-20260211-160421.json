  "content": "Got it — that makes sense. ESG reporting is a death-by-a-thousand-cuts problem, not a single sharp pain.\n\nBut here's the thing: if your v1 product tries to solve *all* of those problems at once, you'll end up with a half-baked everything instead of an excellent something.\n\n**So if you had to pick the *one* frustration that your platform solves better than anyone else in the first version — the thing that makes an SME sustainability manager say \"finally, someone gets it\" — which one would it be?**\n\nIs it the manual data entry (extraction/automation)? The regulatory confidence (Swiss-specific guidance)? The client-ready outputs (professional reports)? Or something else?",
