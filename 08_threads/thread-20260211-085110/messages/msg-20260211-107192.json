  "content": "Hey — this is impressively detailed. You've clearly done deep research on the technical architecture and market landscape.\n\nBut I want to zoom out for a moment and get at the human side of this.\n\n**When a Swiss SME sustainability manager or CFO wakes up Monday morning and has to deal with ESG reporting, what *specifically* makes them want to throw their laptop out the window?**\n\nIs it the hours of manually entering data from invoices? The anxiety about getting regulatory requirements wrong? The cost of consultants? The embarrassment when a big client asks for Scope 3 data and they have nothing? Something else entirely?\n\nI'm looking for the visceral frustration — the \"I can't believe I have to do this again\" moment that makes someone Google \"ESG software Switzerland\" at 11pm.",
