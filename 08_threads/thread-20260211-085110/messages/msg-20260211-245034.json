  "content": "Sequenced by value delivered and build complexity. Start with Phase 1 — it's enough to charge CHF 5K–15K per client.  Sprint 1: Weeks 1–4 Gap Analysis Tool (MVP) → Build: Document upload → AI reads policies/reports → maps against ESRS requirements → Output: Traffic-light gap report (✅ compliant / ⚠️ partial / ❌ missing) → Tech: Bubble form + Flowise RAG pipeline + Claude/GPT-4 API + PDF export → Deliver manually first: upload client docs, run AI analysis, package as PDF report → Price: CHF 5,000–10,000 per assessment Why this order: Highest value, lowest build complexity. Every SME needs this FIRST. It's the diagnostic that creates urgency for everything else. Sprint 2: Weeks 5–8 Materiality Assessment Questionnaire → Build: Guided questionnaire pre-loaded with industry-specific ESRS topics → Output: Visual materiality matrix + stakeholder survey templates → Tech: Bubble multi-step form + scoring logic + chart generation → AI generates initial scoring based on industry/sector/size (your S&P friend calibrates) → Price: CHF 3,000–8,000 per assessment (bundle with gap analysis for CHF 12K–15K) Why this order: Legally required as step 1 of ESRS reporting. Creates the foundation for all other work. Beautiful visual output = impressive deliverable. Sprint 3: Weeks 9–16 Data Collection + KPI Dashboard → Build: Structured data entry forms for E, S, G metrics with validation → Output: Auto-calculated KPIs, trend charts, benchmark comparisons → Tech: Bubble database + calculation engine + dashboard views → Invoice/document OCR for energy bills and receipts (nice-to-have, not MVP) → Price: CHF 300–500/month SaaS subscription per client Why this order: This is where recurring revenue starts. Once data is in your system, switching costs are high. Monthly subscription model begins. Sprint 4: Weeks 17–24 AI Report Generator → Build: Take collected data → generate ESRS-structured narrative + data tables → Output: First-draft sustainability report (70–80% complete), multi-language → Tech: Claude/GPT-4 with structured prompts + your designer's report templates → Human review layer: client + your S&P expert refine before publishing → Price: CHF 8,000–20,000 per annual report generation Why this order: Your team's unique strength. Creative strategist + designer + AI = reports that look and read better than Big 4 output at 1/3 the price. Revenue trajectory with this build sequence Month 2–3 CHF 10–15K 3 gap analyses Month 4–6 CHF 20–30K/mo Assessments + bundles Month 7–12 CHF 30–50K/mo + SaaS subscriptions Year 2 CHF 60–100K/mo + report generation",
