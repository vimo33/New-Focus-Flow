  "content": "here is the updated PRD PRD: AURA — The Zurich Discovery Engine (2026 Pilot)Status: Final Specification for Agent BuildVersion: 4.0 (Council-Ready with Risks & Competitive Contrast)Lead Engineering Team: Claude Code Opus 4.6 (Orchestrator) + sub-agents in tmux mode1. Executive Summary & VisionAURA is an \"Intelligent Discovery Engine\" designed to shift urban tourism from passive observation to narrative-driven participation. Utilizing the 2026 \"Flash-Reasoning\" paradigm, AURA enables a \"point-discover-converse\" loop where users engage in real-time, historically accurate roleplays with AI-powered figures directly anchored to physical landmarks.Core Strategic PillarsExperiential Innovation: Moving users from spectators to characters in a city-wide interactive storyscape.Privacy-First Architecture: On-device processing ensures sensitive visual and location data never leave the device for core operations.Unimpeachable Credibility: A \"Walled Garden\" RAG protocol backed by foundational partnerships with academic institutions.2. Target User Segments (Pilot Focus)PersonaPrimary MotivationPain Point AddressedBehavior ReplacedQuinn (Technophile)Autonomy & Privacy Distrust of data harvesting and high roaming costs.Replaces generic Google Lens and cloud-heavy guides.Max (Short-Stay)Efficiency & FOMO Inflexible 3-hour tours that don't fit tight schedules.Replaces linear, non-interactive audio walks.Kris (Local)Novelty & Discovery The belief that they \"already know\" the city.Replaces standard \"tourist trap\" information tools.Pat (Family)Edutainment Difficulty engaging teenagers with static museum plaques.Replaces social isolation of traditional headsets.3. 2026 \"Flash-Reasoning\" Technical StackThe stack is architected for \"On-Device First\" execution to ensure sub-200ms latency and total data residency.3.1 Core Model SpecificationReasoning Orchestrator: MobileLLM-Pro (P1).Spec: 1.08B parameters, distilled from Llama 4-Scout.Capabilities: 128k context window allows for deep \"historical memory\" during multi-stop journeys.Vision & Landmark Grounding: Qwen3-VL (Nano).Spec: Native multimodal architecture.Capabilities: Supports 3D Grounding, predicting real-world size and depth to anchor future AR overlays with centimeter precision.Dynamic Speech Engine: NeuTTS-Nano.Spec: 120M active parameters, GGUF format.Capabilities: Real-time, unscripted speech synthesis with zero-shot voice cloning (e.g., specific Swiss-German accents for historical authenticity).Production Fallback (2022+ Hardware): Gemma 3n 1B.Rationale: Specifically optimized for 4GB RAM devices; provides 2500+ tok/sec prefill latency on LiteRT.3.2 Framework & DeploymentInference Engine: Google AI Edge (LiteRT).Rationale: Native wrappers for iOS/Android provide superior thermal management compared to WebGPU previews for high-stakes ML workloads.Quantization: SpinQuant (4-bit W+A+KV).Effect: Reduces memory traffic per token by 4x while maintaining <3% accuracy loss.Local Storage: SQLite.Usage: Stores the encrypted \"City Pack\" containing landmark IDs, character \"Constitutions,\" and vetted historical nodes.4. Content Architecture: The Extractive-Safe PivotTo resolve the \"hallucination vs. emergent dialogue\" paradox, AURA adopts a multi-layered content strategy.Walled Garden RAG: The LLM is restricted to rephrasing expert-vetted narrative nodes. It is physically unable to access the internet during the core loop.Character Constitution: Each figure (e.g., Zwingli) has a hard-coded \"Persona Barrier.\" If a user asks an out-of-scope question, the character is prompted to decline in-character.AI-Assisted Synthesis: Historians provide primary sources; AI drafts narrative branches which are then human-reviewed, maintaining a <$500/landmark production cost.5. Competitive Landscape: Strategic ContrastAURA fills the \"Blue Ocean\" between transactional booking platforms and static content apps.CompetitorValue PropositionAURA Differentiator (Why they fail)Rick Steves Audio EuropeFree, high-quality audio tours for history buffs.Interactivity: Rick Steves is \"old-school\" and linear; users cannot ask questions. App often crashes if users try to take photos during a tour.Google Lens / Arts & CultureVisual recognition and broad informational snippets.Narrative Depth: Fails to provide a cohesive, vetted historical story, instead offering fragmented search results.izi.TRAVELLargest global library of audio tours.Quality Control: Focus on quantity leads to generic, often low-quality storytelling compared to AURA’s institutionally vetted narratives.QuestoGamified city exploration through treasure hunts.Immersion: Primarily text-based challenges; lacks the audio depth and AI character engagement required for hands-free immersion.Zürich City Guide (Official)Logistical hub for transport and museum tickets.Utility & Magic: Criticized for inaccurate map data and clunky UI. Lacks the \"wow factor\" of AI-driven discovery.6. Privacy Architecture & Compliance6.1 PrivacyEnforcer ModuleImplemented as a Native Socket Interceptor, this module actively kills any outgoing network calls during the \"Core Discovery Loop\". It provides compile-time verification that third-party SDKs (e.g., analytics) are disabled during active sessions.6.2 Dual-Tier TransparencyThe \"Consent Modal\": Users entering \"Deep Conversation\" (Premium Cloud Mode) must toggle an active consent button. The UI must clearly differentiate between \"Private On-Device\" (Green Reticle) and \"Cloud-Enhanced\" (Blue Reticle) modes.Data Minimization: Only anonymized text strings are sent to the cloud for premium reasoning; no biometric or visual metadata is transmitted.7. Business & Sustainability ModelFreemium Flywheel: Unlimited on-device visual recognition and \"Snapshot\" stories are free (Zero marginal cost).Explorer Pass ($14.99): A 72-hour one-time pass for short-stay tourists, reframing the app as a \"Digital Tour Ticket\".Premium Subscription ($9.99/mo): Recurring revenue from local enthusiasts unlocking monthly content drops and cloud reasoning.Strategic Subsidy: Pilot incentivization for the Swiss National Museum via a 10% revenue-sharing model on Explorer Passes sold on-site.8. Critical Risk Inventory & Mitigation PlanRisk CategoryDescriptionMitigation StrategyTechnicalLandmark ID accuracy drops below 95% in rain or low light.Implement a Skeleton Overlay to guide user aim; provide a \"Manual Map Selection\" fallback if confidence scores are low.TechnicalThermal throttling during 15+ min inference sessions.Utilize a Model Swap Protocol: unload vision models from VRAM once identified to prioritize Conversational Engine and save power.PartnershipSwiss National Museum partnership fails to materialize.Pivot to Public Domain/Open Data: Leverage Open Data Zurich APIs and Wikipedia/Project Gutenberg sources to populate the knowledge base.Accuracy\"Walled Garden\" LLM still attempts to hallucinate facts.Hard-code a Persona Barrier prompting characters to stay in-character but decline unvetted queries (e.g., \"I am but a soldier; I know nothing of this\").Adoption5% conversion rate is over-ambitious for travel apps.Frictionless Pricing: Use the $14.99 Explorer Pass to overcome \"subscription fatigue\" common among short-term tourists.9. MVP Roadmap & Success MetricsPhase 1: Local Foundation & Privacy GuardrailsEstablish SQLite schema and PrivacyEnforcer runtime.Validate Gemma 3n 1B fallback performance on 2022-era mid-range devices (4GB RAM).Phase 2: Multimodal Loop IntegrationIntegrate Qwen3-VL (Nano) for landmark ID (<150ms target).Implement NeuTTS-Nano for streaming conversational audio.Phase 3: Pilot Content & Partnership ValidationDeploy 5 landmarks (Altstadt focus) and 2 characters (Zwingli, Gaius Valerius).Sign LOI with Swiss National Museum for content verification.Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)Accuracy: >95% landmark identification rate in varied light conditions.Engagement: >5 conversational turns per user interaction turn.Conversion: >5% free-to-paid conversion (Targeting the Explorer Pass).Approved for Build: AI Council Strategist TeamDate: February 15, 2026",
