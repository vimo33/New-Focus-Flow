  "content": "**Council Readiness Audit**\n\nHere's how your concept maps to what the council evaluates:\n\n✅ **Well-covered:**\n- **Problem & Pain Points** — Four distinct personas with specific, validated frustrations (data harvesting, inflexible tours, \"already seen it\", static plaques)\n- **Target Users** — Detailed persona matrix with motivations and replacement behaviors\n- **Solution Mechanism** — Extremely detailed: specific models (MobileLLM-Pro 1.08B, Qwen3-VL Nano, NeuTTS-Nano), quantization strategy, on-device architecture. Engineers could start building today.\n- **Success Metrics** — Concrete KPIs: >95% landmark ID accuracy, >5 turns/interaction, >5% conversion\n- **MVP Scope** — Clear 3-phase roadmap, pilot scoped to 5 landmarks + 2 characters in Altstadt\n- **Technical Feasibility** — Stack choices justified with hardware constraints, fallback strategy for 2022 devices, thermal management addressed\n- **Business Model** — Freemium with specific pricing ($14.99 Explorer Pass, $9.99/mo Premium), 10% museum rev-share\n\n⚠️ **Needs strengthening:**\n- **Competitive Landscape** — You mention Google Lens, audio walks, museum plaques as *categories* being replaced, but no specific competitor products analyzed (e.g., Rick Steves Audio Europe, Detour, Google Arts & Culture AR). Differentiation is implied but not explicitly contrasted.\n\n❌ **Missing/unclear:**\n- **Risks & Mitigations** — This is the critical gap. The council will immediately ask: What happens if landmark ID drops below 95% in rain/night conditions? If the Swiss National Museum partnership stalls? If content production can't scale beyond 5 landmarks? If users experience thermal throttling during extended sessions? If the \"Walled Garden RAG\" still hallucinates? You've built an exceptional architecture, but there's no explicit risk inventory or mitigation plan.\n\n---\n\n**Assessment:** This is a *very strong* document — 7 out of 9 areas are thoroughly covered. Most concepts need 3-5 rounds of gap-filling; yours needs 1-2.\n\n**To get this council-ready, I need to ask:**\n\nThe feasibility and business agents will scrutinize risk planning heavily, especially for a technically ambitious on-device ML product. What are your **top 3-5 critical risks**, and what's your mitigation strategy for each? Think:\n- Technical (model performance degradation, device compatibility)  \n- Partnership (museum relationship dependencies)  \n- User adoption (conversion rate assumptions)  \n- Operational (content production bottlenecks)",
