  "content": "**SYSTEM REPORT — 2026-02-20**\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Operational\n\n- **Conversation & tools** — All capability domains responding (inbox, projects, ideas, council, CRM, sales, content, research, profiling)\n- **Data layer** — Vault accessible, 20 projects indexed, 3 ideas, 1 deal, sales pipeline tracking live\n- **Intelligence services** — Morning briefings, weekly reports, dashboard summaries functional\n- **Network analysis** — Contact graph, clustering, opportunity detection online\n- **Financial tracking** — Revenue/costs/runway calculations active\n- **Dev flow** — Project scaffolding, spec generation available\n\n---\n\n## 🟡 Degraded\n\n**Memory search (HIGH)** — 0 files indexed by the memory plugin. `memory/2026-02-16.md` exists with real content but isn't searchable. I can't recall past context via `memory_search` — only by manually reading date-stamped files.\n\n**CLI auth (MEDIUM)** — Device token mismatch blocks gateway commands. You can still use the web interface, but CLI is locked out.\n\n---\n\n## 🔵 Incomplete\n\n**Profiling (23%)** — I know your portfolio and strategic directive, but missing:\n- Monthly expense baseline (limits runway accuracy)\n- Project revenue potential (can't prioritize by income)\n- Network relationship depth (can't identify warm intros)\n- Partner dynamics with Savya\n- Client satisfaction/renewal likelihood\n\n**Setup artifacts** — `BOOTSTRAP.md` still present, `IDENTITY.md` / `USER.md` blank. Minor but signals incomplete first-run.\n\n---\n\n## 📦 Pending\n\n**Update available** — `2026.2.17` waiting. Current build is older.\n\n---\n\n## Diagnostics Next\n\nWant me to:\n1. **Inspect memory plugin config** (figure out why indexing failed)\n2. **Generate profiling gap report** (what I still need to know)\n3. **Check update changelog** (see what 2026.2.17 includes)\n\nWhich one first?",
