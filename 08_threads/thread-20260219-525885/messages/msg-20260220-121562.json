  "content": "No. Three systems are degraded:\n\n**1. Memory indexing** — 0 files indexed despite `memory/2026-02-16.md` existing. I can't search past context.\n\n**2. CLI authentication** — Device token mismatch. Gateway commands fail.\n\n**3. Profile completeness** — 23% known. Missing financial baseline, project revenue potential, network depth.\n\nCore conversation, tools, and data access are working. But I'm partially blind (no memory search) and the setup is incomplete.\n\nWant me to run diagnostics on the memory system first?",
