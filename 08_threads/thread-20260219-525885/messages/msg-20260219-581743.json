  "content": "Here's what I found across system, workspace, and data layers:\n\n---\n\n## Issues Found\n\n### 🔴 Critical\n\n**1. Device Token Mismatch**\nThe gateway is running but the CLI can't authenticate to it:\n> `unauthorized: device token mismatch (rotate/reissue device token)`\nThis means CLI commands can't talk to the gateway. Needs a token rotation or reissue.\n\n---\n\n### 🟡 High Priority\n\n**2. OpenClaw Update Available**\nVersion `2026.2.17` is waiting. Running on an older build.\n\n**3. Memory System Shows 0 Files**\nDespite `memory/2026-02-16.md` existing with real content, OpenClaw's memory plugin reports **0 files, 0 chunks**. The memory isn't being indexed — so I can't search it via `memory_search`. Long-term context is effectively blind.\n\n**4. No MEMORY.md**\nLong-term curated memory file doesn't exist. All persistence is in the daily note only.\n\n---\n\n### 🟠 Medium Priority\n\n**5. BOOTSTRAP.md Still Exists**\nPer `AGENTS.md`: delete it after first-run setup. It's still sitting in the workspace — suggests initial setup was never fully completed.\n\n**6. IDENTITY.md & USER.md Blank**\nBoth are template stubs — no name, no timezone, nothing. These were supposed to be filled during bootstrapping.\n\n**7. tasks.json is Stale Placeholder**\nContains one entry: \"Buy groceries\" from Feb 2025. Not part of Nitara's task system.\n\n---\n\n### 🔵 Low Priority\n\n**8. Security Warning: Untrusted Proxy Headers**\nIf the UI is behind a reverse proxy, `gateway.trustedProxies` needs to be set.\n\n**9. No Channels Configured**\nNo external messaging channels (Telegram, WhatsApp, etc.) are connected.\n\n---\n\n## What Needs Action\n\n| Issue | Action |\n|---|---|\n| Device token mismatch | Rotate/reissue device token |\n| Update available | Run `openclaw gateway update` or update via CLI |\n| Memory not indexing | Investigate memory plugin config |\n| MEMORY.md missing | Create it |\n| BOOTSTRAP.md | Delete it |\n| IDENTITY.md / USER.md | Fill them in |\n\nWant me to start resolving these? I can handle the file cleanup and MEMORY.md creation immediately. The token mismatch and update may need your involvement.",
