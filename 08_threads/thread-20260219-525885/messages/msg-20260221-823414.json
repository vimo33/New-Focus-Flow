  "content": "Yes. Claude API is working — you're talking to me right now via `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5`.\n\nFrom the config check:\n- **Provider:** Anthropic\n- **Model:** `claude-sonnet-4-5` (default)\n- **Auth method:** API key (configured and valid)\n- **Status:** Operational\n\nThe device token mismatch is a **CLI ↔ Gateway** auth issue — not Claude API auth. The CLI can't authenticate to the local gateway process, but the gateway itself can talk to Claude fine.\n\n**What's working:**\n- Web chat → Gateway → Claude ✅\n- Tools, memory writes, all capabilities ✅\n\n**What's broken:**\n- `openclaw` CLI commands → Gateway ❌ (token mismatch)\n\n**What's missing:**\n- Memory search (needs embedding provider, unrelated to Claude auth)\n\nSo yes, Claude auth is solid. The two issues are **CLI access** and **memory indexing** — both local infrastructure problems, not Claude API problems.\n\nWant me to focus on fixing the CLI token or the memory embeddings first?",
