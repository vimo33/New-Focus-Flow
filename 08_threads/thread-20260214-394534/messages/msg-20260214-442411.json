  "content": "**Council Readiness Audit**\n\nThis is an exceptionally comprehensive brief. You've done the work.\n\nHere's how it maps to council evaluation criteria:\n\n✅ **Strongly covered:**\n- **Problem definition** — specific (context-switching tax, decision fatigue, execution bottleneck), quantified (15-23 min recovery), validated user profile\n- **Target users** — three segments with addressable market numbers, geographic strategy, expansion path\n- **Solution mechanism** — detailed architecture, six principles, seven-stage lifecycle, technology choices justified — engineers and designers could start today\n- **MVP scope** — v1.0 is *operational* (60 endpoints, 6 screens, AI Council live), 6-phase roadmap with week-by-week breakdown\n- **Technical feasibility** — architecture, data model evolution, tool integration, explicit acknowledgment of solo-dev timeline risk\n- **Business model** — open-core with four tiers, unit economics analyzed (including margin concerns + mitigations), geographic pricing strategy\n- **Competitive landscape** — alternatives named, differentiation clear (no one combines AI venture orchestration + full business lifecycle)\n- **Risks & mitigations** — technical, market, and business risks identified with specific countermeasures\n\n⚠️ **One gap the council will flag:**\n\n**Success Metrics** — You have revenue projections and beta user targets, but you're missing *leading indicators of product health*:\n- What activation looks like (e.g., \"user creates first venture + runs Council eval within 7 days\")\n- Retention targets (D7/D30/D90)\n- Engagement thresholds that predict retention (e.g., \"users who complete 3+ pipeline phases in month 1 have 80% D90 retention\")\n- Council usage patterns that signal value (how often? for what decisions?)\n- Portfolio size at which users see ROI (1 venture? 3? 5?)\n\nThese are the metrics that tell you if the *product* is working before revenue lags catch up. The feasibility and business agents will want to know what \"good\" looks like in weeks 1-12, not just year 1-3 ARR.\n\n---\n\n**To get this council-ready, I need to ask:**\n\nWhat are the **leading product health metrics** that will tell you Focus Flow OS is working in the first 90 days of beta? \n\nFor example:\n- What does successful activation look like for a new user?\n- What usage patterns (Council evals run, pipeline phases completed, ventures managed) correlate with retention?\n- At what point does a user go from \"trying it\" to \"relying on it\"?\n\nIf you don't have data yet (which is fine — v1.0 just launched), what are your *hypotheses* about these thresholds? The council will evaluate whether those benchmarks are realistic and whether you're measuring the right things.\n\n---\n\n**That said:** This document is already 90% council-ready. If you want to proceed now and let the council surface this gap in their evaluation, you can absolutely do that. Your call.",
