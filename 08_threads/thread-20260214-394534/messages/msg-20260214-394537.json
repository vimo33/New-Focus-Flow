  "content": "Focus Flow OS — Vision & Strategy Brief\nFor Council Evaluation\nDocument Version: 1.0\nDate: February 14, 2026\nAuthor: Founder\nLocation: Zürich, Switzerland\nStatus: Draft for Council Review\nExecutive Summary\nFocus Flow OS is an AI-native venture operating system designed for solo entrepreneurs and small teams who build and manage portfolios of diverse businesses. Unlike project management tools that organize work, or AI coding assistants that write code, Focus Flow OS provides an autonomous AI agent — a \"co-CEO\" — that orchestrates the entire lifecycle of a venture: from initial idea through validation, development, marketing, sales, operations, and ongoing management.\nThe system is operational today as a personal tool. It runs on a Linux server behind Tailscale VPN, with a React 19 frontend, Express 5 backend, file-based JSON storage, AI classification via Claude through an OpenClaw gateway, a multi-agent AI council for idea evaluation, and a pipeline system that takes projects from concept through specification, design, development, testing, and deployment. Approximately 60 API endpoints are live, 6 UI screens are production-ready, and the system has been in daily use since early February 2026.\nThe vision is to evolve this into a productized platform serving three expanding audiences: solo technical founders managing multiple projects (immediate market), small agencies and consulting firms managing client engagements (near-term market), and corporate innovation labs and venture studios running structured idea-to-business pipelines (future market).\nPart 1: The Problem\nThe Solo Entrepreneur's Operational Nightmare\nThe modern solo entrepreneur does not run one business — they run a portfolio. A typical profile includes a SaaS product in development, a consulting practice generating revenue, a content property building audience, and ideas at various exploration stages. Each venture has its own lifecycle, tasks, contacts, financials, and strategic context. Each requires attention across every business function: product, marketing, sales, support, accounting, and administration.\nToday this entrepreneur uses 10-15 separate tools: Notion, Linear, Figma, VS Code, Stripe, QuickBooks, Mailchimp, a CRM, Slack, Google Calendar, and various AI assistants. None understand the portfolio context. None reason across ventures. None autonomously advance work. The entrepreneur is the sole integrator.\nThis creates three problems. Context-switching tax: moving between tools destroys focus, with recovery taking 15-23 minutes per interruption. Decision fatigue: every venture generates dozens of daily decisions without structured evaluation. Execution bottleneck: the founder is the single point of failure because no tool understands enough context to act autonomously.\nThe Agency Version\nSmall agencies (5-20 people) managing 10-50 concurrent client engagements face a scaled version. They need centralized venture management, templated pipelines per project type, AI-assisted delivery, and role-based access.\nWhy Now\nThree technological shifts make this solvable. Frontier AI models now perform genuine strategic reasoning. AI coding agents produce working software from specs in hours. Agentic frameworks enable autonomous multi-step work with human gating. Their convergence means an AI system can actively do work across a venture portfolio, with the founder as strategic decision-maker rather than sole executor.\nPart 2: The Vision\nWhat Focus Flow OS Becomes\nAn AI-native operating system where an autonomous Core Agent orchestrates the complete lifecycle of every venture. The founder interacts through natural conversation (WhatsApp, Telegram, Slack, web UI), makes decisions at human-in-the-loop gates, and monitors through a command center dashboard. Everything else — research, planning, execution, communication, monitoring — is handled by the Core Agent delegating to specialized tools.\nSix principles: (1) The agent drives, the human gates — an inversion where the AI proactively identifies and executes work, the human reviews at checkpoints. (2) Configuration over code — new venture types, pipelines, and tools added through configuration. (3) Provider-agnostic intelligence — an Inference Router selects models by capability, not hardcoded provider. (4) Progressive autonomy through trust — auto-execute, soft-gate, and hard-gate classifications evolve based on approval patterns. (5) Every venture is first-class — venture-scoped data with cross-venture portfolio intelligence. (6) Tools are capabilities — a registry of tools selected by task requirements, not hardcoded.\nThe Venture Lifecycle\nSeven stages managed through configurable playbook templates: Discovery (ideas captured and explored, agent proactively generates opportunities), Validation (AI Council evaluation with configurable specialist panels scoring viability, feasibility, competition, financials, desirability), Planning (PRDs, proposals, business models, content calendars), Execution (Core Agent delegates to tools: Claude Code for dev, Stitch for design, Content Engine for marketing, Communication Hub for outreach), Launch (deployment, publishing, sending), Operation (monitoring, financial tracking, support, marketing cadence), Growth (performance analysis, opportunity identification, strategic recommendations).\nThe AI Council is invocable at any decision point — pricing, hiring, go-to-market, partnerships — not just idea validation. Council composition adapts to decision type.\nPart 3: What Exists Today\nFocus Flow OS v1.0 operational since February 3, 2026:\nBackend: Express 5.2.1, TypeScript, ~60 endpoints covering capture/inbox (6), tasks (4), projects (7), ideas (4), pipeline (7), orchestrator (4), threads (5), design (3), CRM/sales (9), health (6), system utilities (8).\nFrontend: React 19, Vite, Tailwind CSS 4, Zustand. 6 production screens (Dashboard, Capture, Inbox, Projects, Project Detail, Calendar), 3 built but unrouted (Ideas, Wellbeing, Voice). Pipeline visualization showing phase progression with sub-step tracking.\nAI Council: Multi-agent evaluation with dynamic composition, parallel Opus 4.6 evaluation with web research, individual scored assessments, synthesized verdicts with scores, reasoning, concerns, and next steps. Live and producing real evaluations (e.g., ATX project received 4.6/10 with detailed risk analysis).\nPipeline Engine: Phase-based progression from concept through deploy/live with sub-steps and human approval gates.\nOrchestrator: Autonomous PRD-to-code state machine (intake → spec → design → code → validation → deployment).\nVault: File-based JSON storage in numbered directories (00_inbox through 09_crm).\nIntegrations: OpenClaw Gateway (port 18789), Telegram Bot, Stitch design, Claude Code with 3 agents and 4 skills, Docker Compose, systemd.\nTesting: 150+ Playwright E2E tests, 18+ API endpoints verified, cross-browser compatible, all performance targets met. Production grade A- (90%).\nPart 4: Technical Architecture (Target State)\nCore Agent\nCustom orchestration layer (~1,000-1,500 lines TypeScript) inside Focus Flow backend. Not a third-party framework. Three layers: Brain (Inference Router abstracting model selection by capability), Memory (venture database migrated JSON → SQLite → PostgreSQL), Hands (Tool Registry with Docker-sandboxed execution). Six-state machine: IDLE → CONVERSING → PLANNING → EXECUTING → AWAITING_APPROVAL → MONITORING, plus parallel RESEARCHING and EVALUATING. OpenClaw as messaging gateway only. NanoClaw's container isolation pattern for tool execution.\nData Model\nVenture-scoped typed entities with Entity Type Registry. Universal entity_links table for cross-cutting relationships. Incremental migration: Repository pattern → dual-write → SQLite primary → eventual PostgreSQL.\nPipeline Engine\nXState v5 + BullMQ replacing rigid pipeline. JSON playbook templates per venture type. Durable suspend/resume for human-in-the-loop gates.\nAuthorization\nCASL with three-phase evolution: invisible auth now → venture-scoped RBAC with collaborators → project-level grants with PostgreSQL RLS.\nUI\nThree-layer progressive disclosure (Portfolio → Venture → Deep Work). React 19 Activity for state-preserving venture switching. Cmd+K command palette. Optimistic updates.\nTool Registry (First 6 Tools)\nClaude Code (development), OpenCode CLI (dev diversity/fallback), Stitch/Pencil (design), Content Engine (marketing/docs), Communication Hub (email/CRM), Deploy & Monitor (infrastructure).\nPart 5: Market Opportunity\nSolo technical founders: 2-5M globally. At CHF 79/month, 1% of US/EU addressable (7,000 users) = ~CHF 6.6M ARR.\nSmall agencies/consulting: 500K+ firms globally, high density in India. At CHF 25/user/month avg 10 users, 0.5% (2,500 firms) = ~CHF 7.5M ARR.\nCorporate innovation (future): CHF 5K-50K/year deals, longer sales cycles.\nCompetitive landscape: No product combines AI venture orchestration with end-to-end business lifecycle management. PM tools (Linear, Asana) lack AI execution. AI coding tools (Claude Code, Cursor) lack business operations. Personal AI agents (OpenClaw) lack venture portfolios. Automation platforms (Zapier, n8n) lack intelligence.\nPart 6: Business Model\nOpen-core: base system open-source (MIT), premium capabilities paid.\nFree tier: core capture, inbox, tasks, projects, ideas, health. Basic pipeline. Self-hosted, BYOK.\nPro (CHF 79/month): AI Council, Core Agent orchestration, Tool Registry, opportunity scanning, advanced templates.\nTeam (CHF 25/month/user, min 5): multi-user RBAC, collaboration, shared templates, client portal.\nEnterprise (custom): SSO, audit trails, dedicated support, on-premise.\nRevenue projections: Y1 ~CHF 570K ARR (500 Pro + 50 Teams). Y2 ~CHF 2.5M. Y3 ~CHF 7-10M.\nUnit economics concern: CHF 79 revenue minus CHF 30-60 inference cost = 25-60% gross margin. Optimization through caching, model routing, and common evaluation caching targets 50-70%.\nGeographic pricing: standard for US/EU, INR 2,000/month (~CHF 22) for India with PPP adjustment.\nPart 7: Go-to-Market\nPhase 1 (months 1-3): 50 beta founders, free Pro access for feedback. Open-source core on GitHub.\nPhase 2 (months 3-9): community-led growth via technical blog posts, YouTube demos, Product Hunt launch. India market via founder's networks — co-working spaces, incubators, freelance communities.\nPhase 3 (months 9-18): Team tier launch targeting agencies. Indian IT services as primary target. Paid acquisition evaluation.\nGeographic sequence: global English-language communities first, India in parallel through networks, European enterprise with Swiss positioning in Phase 3+.\nPart 8: Company Structure\nSwiss GmbH (CHF 20K min capital) as primary entity. Indian subsidiary later for operations. Swiss entity owns IP, Indian operates under license. Pre-revenue cash outlay under CHF 10K.\nPart 9: Development Roadmap\nPhase 1 (weeks 1-4): Repository pattern, venture_id on all entities, Entity Type Registry, CASL, SQLite migration, authentication.\nPhase 2 (weeks 5-10): Inference Router, Core Agent state machine (XState v5), Tool Runner (Docker), first tool (Claude Code), configurable pipeline (BullMQ), trust gradient.\nPhase 3 (weeks 11-13): Council generalization to reusable framework, decision-type routing, structured output schemas, actionable verdicts.\nPhase 4 (weeks 14-17): Three-layer UI, venture switching, Cmd+K palette, optimistic updates, portfolio dashboard.\nPhase 5 (weeks 18-22): Auth onboarding, Stripe billing, documentation, open-source prep, beta launch with 50 users, remaining 5 tools.\nPhase 6 (weeks 23-30): Multi-user RBAC, collaboration, Team tier, India localization, PostgreSQL evaluation.\nPart 10: Risk Assessment\nTechnical: AI model dependency (mitigated by provider-agnostic router), scaling complexity (mitigated by incremental migration), tool orchestration reliability (mitigated by persistent state machine + trust gradient).\nMarket: competitive absorption by well-funded tools adding AI (mitigated by venture-lifecycle specificity), price sensitivity (mitigated by free tier + localized pricing), adoption friction of self-hosted (mitigated by future hosted version).\nBusiness: solo founder risk (mitigated by Core Agent reducing dependency + open-source community), revenue concentration (mitigated by broad free user base).\nPart 11: Questions for the Council\n\nMarket viability: Is \"AI venture operating system for solo founders\" a real category or positioning fantasy? Can it create a category, or will existing tools absorb it?\nTechnical feasibility: Is the 30-week roadmap achievable for a solo developer using AI coding agents? Does it require a team?\nCompetitive moat: What is most defensible — open-source community, AI council pattern, pipeline engine, venture data model? Where should investment concentrate?\nPricing validation: Is CHF 79/month right for solo founders? Is INR 2,000/month viable for India?\nGo-to-market priority: Should initial launch target US/global indie hackers, Indian founders, or both simultaneously?\nBuild vs. buy: Are there components where adopting existing open-source would be faster (e.g., Temporal instead of XState + BullMQ)?\nRisk prioritization: Which risk is most likely and most damaging? What additional mitigation?\n\nEND VISION DOCUMENT",
