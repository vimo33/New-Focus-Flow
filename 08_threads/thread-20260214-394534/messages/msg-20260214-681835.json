  "content": "Activation Definition Activation is defined as a three-step sequence completed within 7 days of first use: the user creates their first venture, runs at least one AI Council evaluation, and advances at least one project past the concept phase into planning or specification. This sequence matters because each step demonstrates a different layer of value — venture creation proves the data model maps to real work, the council evaluation delivers the \"aha moment\" that no competing tool offers, and advancing past concept proves trust in the workflow. A softer leading signal is 5+ items captured and 3+ processed through inbox classification within 48 hours, indicating Focus Flow has become the user's primary capture surface. The critical anti-pattern to monitor is users who run exactly one council evaluation and never return. This signals the council is a novelty rather than a habit, likely because the verdict-to-action path is too weak. Retention-Predictive Engagement Thresholds D7 retention predictor: user has 2+ ventures created and 3+ Core Agent interactions (chat or command). Two ventures means they're beginning to see the portfolio dimension, which is the core differentiator. D30 retention predictor: at least one pipeline advanced past the halfway point (through planning into execution) AND 3+ council evaluations run. This indicates the system is trusted with real work and the council has become a decision-making habit rather than a one-time experiment. D90 retention predictor: 3+ active ventures with ongoing activity across at least 2 of them, plus at least one external action completed through the system (document generated, code deployed, or communication sent). At D90, the question is whether Focus Flow has become infrastructure. The Portfolio Gravity Hypothesis The ROI inflection point is hypothesized at 3 active ventures. With 1 venture, Focus Flow is an overpowered project management tool. With 2, the portfolio view adds value but isn't essential. At 3 ventures, cross-venture dashboards, context-switching via venture tabs, and the Core Agent's ability to reason across the portfolio become genuinely difficult to replicate with separate tools. This is the moment a user transitions from \"trying it\" to \"relying on it.\" Council Usage Patterns Healthy council usage follows a bursty pattern — 3-5 evaluations during discovery/validation weeks, near-zero during execution phases, spikes again at strategic decision points (pricing, partnerships, pivots). The retention-predictive signal is multi-decision-type usage: users who run council evaluations for at least 2 different decision types (for example, idea validation in month 1, then a pricing or go-to-market decision in month 2) have internalized the council as a general decision-support tool rather than a one-trick validator. The most important council health metric is \"verdict-to-action conversion rate\" — what percentage of council verdicts lead to the user creating tasks, starting pipelines, or modifying plans based on recommendations. If verdicts are read but not acted on, the council is producing entertainment rather than value. Beta Success Criteria (50-User Cohort, Weeks 1-12) Weeks 1-4 (activation): target 60% activation rate (30/50 users complete the three-step sequence). Diagnostic metric is \"time to first council evaluation\" — if median exceeds 3 days, the onboarding friction is too high. Weeks 5-8 (habit formation): target 20/50 users returning 3+ times per week with 2+ active ventures. D30 retention target is 50% (25 active users). Diagnostic is whether return visits advance pipelines and run evaluations versus only browsing dashboards. Weeks 9-12 (reliance): target 15/50 users scoring NPS 8+ (\"essential\" or \"very useful\"). At least 10 users should have completed a full pipeline cycle (concept through deployment) for at least one project. D90 retention target is 30% (15 users). The single most important metric across all 90 days is \"ventures with active pipelines progressing through phases.\" If pipelines advance, the core value loop is working and retention, willingness to pay, and word-of-mouth will follow. If pipelines stall, the engine isn't delivering enough value relative to the effort of using it. These are hypotheses to validate, not commitments. The first 90 days of beta exist specifically to calibrate or disprove these thresholds, and the council should evaluate whether these benchmarks are realistic, whether the right things are being measured, and what's missing.",
