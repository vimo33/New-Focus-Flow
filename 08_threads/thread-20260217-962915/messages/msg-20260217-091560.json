  "content": "My memory says the evaluated specs were labeled V5.0 — but your frontend showing no result is significant. There are two possibilities:\n\nOne: the council ran in a session that never got linked to this project ID. The score of 4.3 exists in memory context but not attached to the project record in the system.\n\nTwo: what was evaluated wasn't truly V5.0 — it may have been an earlier draft that got retroactively labeled V5.\n\nEither way, if you're not seeing a result in the frontend, the project has no official council verdict on record. That means we should run it fresh — especially if V5.0 \"post-freedom design\" represents a substantive departure from what the 4.3 verdict was based on.\n\nWant me to kick off the council now against the current V5.0 specs? I'll pull the project details and submit it.",
