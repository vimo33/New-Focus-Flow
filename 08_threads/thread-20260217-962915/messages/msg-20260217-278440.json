  "content": "Claude Code is installed and ready — version 2.1.44 at `/usr/bin/claude`.\n\nSo the full picture: I can spin up Claude Code as a background coding agent, point it at any project directory in your workspace, give it a task, and monitor it while it works. It handles file editing, running commands, writing specs, scaffolding — the works.\n\nFor Mirari specifically, once the council returns its verdict, I could hand Claude Code a task like \"scaffold the V5.0 project structure based on these specs\" and let it build while we strategize. Good to have in the toolkit.",
