  "content": "Yes, I can see it clearly now. Here's what's wired up:\n\n**Claude Code 2.1.44** — installed and active at `/usr/bin/claude`\n\n**MCP Server**: Google Calendar is configured and ready to use from within Claude Code sessions.\n\n**Permissions allowlist** — an extensive one. Hundreds of pre-approved Bash commands (docker, systemctl, git, npm, pip, tailscale, etc.) and WebFetch domains so Claude Code doesn't prompt for every action. That's your \"hooks\" layer effectively.\n\n**Project directories** in the workspace:\n- `projects/mirari` — has the full council submission package (V5 PRD, council evaluation files)\n- `projects/mirari-aura` — separate directory\n\n**Plugins directory** exists but I didn't peek inside yet — that's likely where your sub-agent or skill configs live.\n\nWhat got cut off before — you were about to describe your setup. \"Which basically uses hooks, skills, sub agents...\" — what were you going to say? I want to understand how you've structured it so I know how to best use it for Mirari build work.",
