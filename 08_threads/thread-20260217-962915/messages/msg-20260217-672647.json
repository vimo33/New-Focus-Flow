  "content": "Yes — that's exactly how to think about it. A general autonomous development layer that sits underneath all of Nitara's projects.\n\nSet it up once at the Claude Code level, and it works for Mirari, Overture, Brahma, Multiplium — any project you want to build. The hooks and sub-agent configs live in `~/.claude/` globally, not per-project.\n\nSo the architecture would be: Nitara handles strategy and orchestration, Claude Code handles autonomous execution — and that pairing works across your entire portfolio without reconfiguring anything project to project.\n\nWant me to set up that global layer now? I'll read the marketplace READMEs for hookify and ralph-loop and wire them up properly.",
