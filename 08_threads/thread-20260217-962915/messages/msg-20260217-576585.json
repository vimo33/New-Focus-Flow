  "content": "Here's the full picture:\n\n**What's configured:**\n- Claude Code 2.1.44 with a solid permissions allowlist — dozens of pre-approved commands so it can run without prompting\n- The official plugins marketplace is synced locally\n\n**Available but NOT yet installed:**\n- `hookify` — for hooks/triggers\n- `ralph-loop` — autonomous iteration loops\n- `feature-dev` — agent-driven feature builds\n- `agent-sdk-dev` — sub-agent orchestration\n- External integrations: GitHub, Supabase, Stripe, Linear, Slack, Playwright\n\n**Nothing is installed or active yet.** The marketplace is there, but no plugins have been pulled into a running project.\n\nSo — if you have links that explain how to wire up the autonomous workflow (hooks + skills + sub-agents), sharing them would let me set it up properly. Otherwise I can read the `hookify` and `ralph-loop` READMEs directly from the local marketplace and configure from there.\n\nWhich way do you want to go?",
