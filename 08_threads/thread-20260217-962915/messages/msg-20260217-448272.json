  "content": "Good picture now. Let me check the key plugins relevant to autonomous operation:\n\nClear picture now. Here's what's actually set up:\n\n**What exists:**\n- Claude Code 2.1.44 with a broad permissions allowlist — ready to run autonomously\n- The official Claude plugins marketplace is synced, including **hookify** (hooks), **ralph-loop** (autonomous loops), **feature-dev** (agent-driven feature builds), and **agent-sdk-dev** (sub-agent orchestration)\n- External plugins available: GitHub, Supabase, Stripe, Playwright, Linear, Slack, etc.\n\n**What's NOT yet configured:**\n- Hooks aren't wired into `settings.local.json` yet — no active hook definitions\n- Only one skill is installed (`keybindings-help`) — the autonomous skills like hookify and ralph-loop are available in the marketplace but not installed\n\nSo the short answer: the foundation is there but the autonomous loop isn't fully wired up yet. You likely have links that describe how to install and configure those plugins properly — hookify for triggers, ralph-loop for autonomous iteration, feature-dev for agent-driven builds.\n\nIf you share those links, I can read them and get the full setup configured correctly. Or if you want, I can look at the hookify and ralph-loop plugin READMEs that are already synced locally and set them up from there.\n\n⚠️ 🛠️ Exec: `cat ~/.claude/settings.local.json | grep -A5 '\"hooks\"' | head -30 2>/dev/null; grep -c \"hooks\" ~/.claude/settings.local.json` failed: 0",
