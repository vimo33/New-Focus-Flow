  "content": "Got it — so you've got a Claude Code environment wired up with hooks for automation triggers, skills for extending capability, and sub-agents for parallel workstreams. That's a solid multi-agent architecture.\n\nThe question is whether OpenClaw's coding-agent skill talks to that same Claude Code instance, or if they're running separately. Let me pull up the skill and see how it's configured — then we'll know exactly what you have access to from here.\n\nHere's what's wired up. The skill supports Claude Code, Codex CLI, OpenCode, and Pi — all runnable as background PTY processes with monitoring via the process tool.\n\nSo from here, I can spawn a Claude Code agent in any project directory, give it a task, and watch it run — hooks, skills, and sub-agents all intact since it's running in your actual filesystem. The orchestration layer is already there.\n\nThe key distinction: your Claude Code setup handles the coding intelligence. OpenClaw handles the orchestration layer — spawning it, monitoring progress, routing the output back to you, and chaining it with the rest of the Nitara systems like project management and specs.\n\nFor Mirari specifically — once the council verdict lands, I could immediately hand off to Claude Code to start scaffolding whatever the council recommends we build first. One pipeline, no manual handoff.\n\nWant me to check if `claude` is available in the current environment?\n\nClaude Code 2.1.44 is live in this environment. We can use it directly from here — no extra setup needed.",
