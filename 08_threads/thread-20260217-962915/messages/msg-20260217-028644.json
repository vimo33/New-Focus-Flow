  "content": "The council previously scored Mirari at 4.3/10 and recommended rejection. Before I fire up a fresh evaluation, one question: has the core concept changed since that submission, or are we running the same V5.0 specs through again?\n\nIf we've iterated — different go-to-market, revised tech assumptions, narrower scope — a fresh council run makes sense. If not, we'd likely get the same verdict. The council was specific about the technology-market timing gap.\n\nWhat's changed?",
