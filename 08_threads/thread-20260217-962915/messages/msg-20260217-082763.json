  "content": "Let me check.\n\nThe verdict is already in — completed earlier today.\n\n**Mirari V5.0: 5.5/10 — NEEDS INFO**\n\nNot a rejection. The council is saying the product is worth building, but there are three things to resolve first before committing resources:\n\nOne — tourist willingness-to-pay validation. Book a morning on Bahnhofstrasse, rough demo, 20 tourists, count the yeses.\n\nTwo — hotel distribution. At least one boutique hotel commits to QR card placement before build begins. Free for them, just a handshake.\n\nThree — flip the architecture. GPS-first, cloud-conversation model, on-device only for triggering. Reduces thermal risk and hallucination risk. Three to four weeks added to timeline, no more.\n\nThe biggest insight from the council: distribution is a launch requirement, not a growth-phase activity. Every tourist who finds Mirari will have been placed there by a hotel key card or Zürich Tourismus — not organic App Store discovery. That's the mental model shift needed.\n\nIf you run the validation sprint and come back with positive results, the council estimates the score would jump to 6.8–7.2 and they'd recommend proceed.\n\nWant me to set up the validation sprint as a task list?",
