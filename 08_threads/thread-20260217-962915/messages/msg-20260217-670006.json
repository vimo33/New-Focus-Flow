  "content": "Yes. It's global infrastructure — not tied to Mirari or any single project.\n\nOnce the hooks, skills, and sub-agent loops are configured in Claude Code, they're available for every project in your workspace. Overture, Bramha, FocusFlow, anything. I orchestrate from Nitara, hand off to Claude Code, and it runs autonomously on whichever project directory I point it at.\n\nOne setup, full portfolio coverage. Want me to go ahead and configure it now?",
