  "content": "Executive Brief\n\nGlobal Foundation for Transparent Collective Gatherings\n\nOverview\n\nThe Global Foundation for Transparent Collective Gatherings is a proposed non-profit institution designed to establish a global protocol for trust-based, ethically facilitated, and economically transparent collective experiences.\n\nAcross cities worldwide, immersive gatherings — including movement-based events, sonic experiences, and participatory communal spaces — are growing in cultural relevance. However, these gatherings often lack standardized governance, financial transparency, and independent accountability structures.\n\nThe Foundation addresses this structural gap.\n\n⸻\n\nCore Objective\n\nTo create and steward a globally recognized protocol that ensures:\n\t•\tTransparent economic reporting for all affiliated gatherings\n\t•\tEthical standards and accountability mechanisms for facilitators\n\t•\tDecentralized yet structured local governance\n\t•\tSustainable, non-extractive economic models\n\t•\tInclusive participation not limited by ability to pay\n\nA key objective is to foster economic solidarity within communities, enabling participants with greater financial capacity to support broader access — ensuring gatherings remain accessible while financially sustainable.\n\n⸻\n\nThe Problem\n\nThe current ecosystem of collective experiences often operates without:\n\t•\tClear financial disclosures\n\t•\tDefined surplus allocation models\n\t•\tIndependent ethical oversight\n\t•\tFormalized feedback and review processes\n\t•\tScalable governance structures\n\nAs participation increases, these gaps create risks including opacity, power concentration, ethical ambiguity, and erosion of trust.\n\n⸻\n\nThe Solution\n\nThe Foundation will:\n\t1.\tPublish and steward a public Charter defining:\n\t•\tFinancial transparency standards\n\t•\tEthical facilitation requirements\n\t•\tCommunity accountability processes\n\t•\tPre-declared surplus allocation structures\n\t2.\tVerify and register independent city-based “Nodes” that adopt the protocol.\n\t3.\tMaintain a transparent global governance framework with rotating stewardship.\n\t4.\tPublish annual institutional and financial reports.\n\n⸻\n\nOperating Model\n\nLocal Nodes\n\t•\tOperate autonomously\n\t•\tHost gatherings aligned with the Charter\n\t•\tPublish revenue, cost, and surplus breakdowns\n\t•\tImplement sliding-scale or solidarity-based pricing models\n\t•\tContribute a defined percentage to sustain global infrastructure\n\nGlobal Foundation\n\t•\tMaintains the protocol and brand integrity\n\t•\tOversees verification standards\n\t•\tFacilitates ethical review processes\n\t•\tManages a transparent global treasury\n\n⸻\n\nEconomic Framework\n\nThe Foundation does not extract private profit.\n\nEconomic principles include:\n\t•\tOpen ledger reporting at the gathering level\n\t•\tClearly defined surplus allocation\n\t•\tReasonable, disclosed compensation for institutional roles\n\t•\tCommunity-supported models that encourage equitable participation\n\nParticipation in gatherings should not be limited by financial capacity; solidarity-based pricing structures are encouraged as a core design principle.\n\n⸻\n\nLong-Term Vision\n\nTo establish a globally recognized trust standard for collective gatherings, where affiliation signals:\n\t•\tFinancial transparency\n\t•\tEthical accountability\n\t•\tCommunity governance\n\t•\tInclusive and sustainable economic practice\n\nThe Foundation is designed as durable institutional infrastructure — intended to outlast founders and operate through structured stewardship.",
