  "content": "A mix of all three flexible to curate and find events fitting users needs. Right now its fragmented led by some event companies or artists in silos. Here  below is a transcript from the discussion with my friend. consolidate these and create a detailed concept note ready for council review. Not that we will maybe try and start this simualtneously in Zurich, Bangalore, Goa, San Francisco as the founders are located in all these cities. the 1st group, which is not possible in traditional limit management, right? You cannot say, okay, you know, it didn't work now. I've been charge more, but of course, market that I'm expecting.  But here it's a little more, uh, community management, say, hey, no, when I did this, but, you know, it did work because, It was so much to the profit, maybe, maybe, or this is how much could it be? So the feedback loop is there. I mean, that is what is the different sharing factor.  Yeah, so. The community managers. Or community we will have community ambassadors of sorts.  Yes, the idea was that we have, maybe, this year, 2 notes, a bachelor daughter, honestly, your, uh, Zurich code. Which, uh, that's some, uh, which facilitators, uh, it's been screening. It could be, I think, the year also, the quality of work.  And maybe do like a trial station. and then invites a smaller group for, you know, a session or with another verified facilitator. And then that's how it goes. Then, of course, you can have like your, I mean, like they have stuff like that.  Oh, that's super host and stuff. But then the community, depending on how they vote, they can bring up the special data to a higher banking. And then, of course, partly get the island, thinking, will be able to get better, more comfortable for those events.  Ah, I like this because. As actually... Yeah.  Mm, this makes sense. And. Um...  Yeah, so what's the business model? Like, let's look, let's think about it before business model, maybe let's put ourselves in the shoes of different stakeholders on the platform. As a user, what do I expect from this platform?  What am I happy to kind of get what I'm looking forward to and what kind, what is not available now that I'm getting here. Mm You, you have to... What's happening?  Oh, no, no, no, no. The ones I call on, influence calling, I'll have to wait. Or I'll maybe I'll get all the car into it.  Yeah. Yeah, call from the car.",
