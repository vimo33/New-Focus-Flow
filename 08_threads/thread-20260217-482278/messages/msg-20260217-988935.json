  "content": "I'll prepare Mirari for council evaluation. Let me first read the attached PRD.\n\nPerfect. I'll prepare a comprehensive council evaluation package for Mirari. This will distill the PRD into a structured evaluation framework with clear validation criteria.\n\nCouncil evaluation package complete.\n\n**What I've prepared:**\n\n1. **Executive Brief** — TL;DR for council (what it is, the wedge, revenue model, uncertainty)\n2. **6 Core Evaluations:**\n   - Market Validation (6/10 forecast)\n   - Technical Feasibility (7/10 forecast)\n   - Financial Viability (5/10 forecast)\n   - Founder-Market Fit (7/10 forecast)\n   - Strategic Evaluation (5/10 forecast)\n   - Validation Framework (what would shift to approve/reject)\n\n3. **Composite Score Projection: 6.0/10 → NEEDS INFO**\n\n**Key findings:**\n\n✅ **Strong:**\n- Proven tourist demand (250K/year Zurich)\n- Technical feasibility with your skillset (privacy-first, multimodal AI)\n- Clear differentiation (no competitor has generative dialogue + spatial audio + proactive triggers)\n\n⚠️ **Uncertain:**\n- Willingness to pay CHF 4.99/month (unvalidated)\n- Hotel B2B model (untested, but critical for unit economics)\n- Distribution (Zürich Tourismus partnership not secured)\n- iOS dev capacity (Swift/Metal skills unclear)\n\n**Validation sprint recommended:** 2 weeks, CHF 2K budget\n- Week 1: Technical PoC (single landmark, <2s latency)\n- Week 2: User tests (5 tourists, 3 expats) + hotel outreach\n\n**The income reality check:** 6 months to first revenue, 11 months to break-even, -CHF 22K Year 1. Against your \"income first\" directive, this is a longer play than client work or bootcamps.\n\nReady to submit to the AI Council for full evaluation?",
