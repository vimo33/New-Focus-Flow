I can see there's already a `mirari-aura-prd.md` file in the workspace from earlier today.\n\nWhat would you like me to do with the attached PRD? Should I:\n- Read and review the existing `mirari-aura-prd.md` in the workspace?\n- Help you save the attached file to the workspace?\n- Compare versions?\n- Something else specific to move Mirari toward revenue?",
