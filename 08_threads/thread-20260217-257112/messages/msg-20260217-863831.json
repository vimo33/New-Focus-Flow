  "content": "The Council rejected it. Four point three out of ten.\n\nThe core issue they're flagging is technology-market timing. The Zero-UI vision depends on AR hardware adoption and always-on multimodal streaming that won't be production-ready until twenty twenty-eight at earliest. Battery life collapses under two hours with that stack, thermal throttling kicks in, and latency breaks the proactive experience you're designing for.\n\nThe deeper problem they identified: you're solving a usability problem tourists don't actually have. The assumption that people want continuous AI-driven narration over serendipitous discovery is unvalidated. Voice-first interfaces already failed commercial validation in travel contexts, and the always-on proactive model creates cognitive overload and safety conflicts.\n\nHere's what's salvageable. The Council thinks the content hypothesis—historical roleplay with character-driven dialogues—might have real pull. But it needs to be tested independently from the form factor. Their recommendation: strip away the Zero-UI and AR dependencies, build a phone-first MVP with pull-based discovery instead of proactive narration. User points camera, AI offers optional context. That gives control back, reduces cognitive load, and you can validate whether the storytelling layer actually hooks people.\n\nWant me to scope that phone-first MVP as a fundable Phase One, or does this feedback change your appetite for the project entirely?",
