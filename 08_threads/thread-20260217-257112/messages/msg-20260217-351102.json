  "content": "I'll grab the PRD and take a look.\n\nThe fetch only pulled the title. Google Docs sometimes blocks content extraction. Let me try the export URL to get the full document.\n\nYes, exactly. This is Mirari (AURA - Zurich Temporal Lens), Version 5.0. It's a substantial update from the earlier concept—now framed as a \"Zero-UI invisible companion\" with full-duplex multimodal streaming, proactive landmark identification, and spatial audio layering.\n\nKey shifts I'm seeing:\n- **Interaction model**: Moved from \"point-and-identify\" to continuous perception stream\n- **Tech stack**: MiniCPM-o 4.5 for omnimodal processing, Qwen3-VL for spatial grounding, MobileLLM-Pro for reasoning\n- **Content strategy**: Generative World Engine with character constitutions instead of branching scripts\n- **Privacy**: On-device secure enclave reasoning with differential anonymization\n\nWant me to save this to the workspace and update the project record with these new details? Or do you want to run this through the Council first to validate the updated vision?",
