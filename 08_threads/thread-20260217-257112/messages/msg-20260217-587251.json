  "content": "Got it. Saving this to the workspace now.\n\nSaved to `[REDACTED_PATH]\n\nThis is a substantial evolution. Version 5.0 reframes AURA from a \"point-and-identify tourist app\" into a **Zero-UI temporal companion**—proactive, voice-first, full-duplex multimodal streaming. The technical stack (MiniCPM-o 4.5, Qwen3-VL, MobileLLM-Pro) positions this as bleeding-edge research execution, not incremental feature work.\n\nWhat I'm seeing strategically:\n\n**Strengths:**\n- Clear differentiation from Google Lens / museum guides (proactive + generative vs. reactive + scripted)\n- Privacy-first architecture addresses real Swiss/EU regulatory constraints\n- Council already approved it (Feb 15)—validation checkpoint passed\n\n**Gap I'm noticing:**\n- **No monetization strategy.** KPIs cover immersion and retention, but I see zero mention of pricing, revenue model, or path to first dollar. That's a problem given your directive to prioritize income.\n\n**The real question:**\nIs this a **funded R&D project** (requires investors/grants to build the ideal vision) or a **bootstrapped MVP** (needs to be staged into a fundable pilot that generates revenue)?\n\nIf it's the latter, we should map a Phase 1 that validates the core hook (proactive voice + historical roleplay) without building the full spatial audio + AR + generative world engine up front. That buys you proof of concept with 10-20% of the complexity.\n\nWhat's your intent here—build the full vision, or stage it toward revenue?",
