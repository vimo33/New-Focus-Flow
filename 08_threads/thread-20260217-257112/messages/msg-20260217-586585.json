  "content": "Got it—I see the full PRD now. This is Version 5.0, the \"Post-Freedom Design\" update.\n\nLet me save this to the workspace under the Mirari project, then we can talk through what's changed and what it means for execution.\n\nSaved to `[REDACTED_PATH]\n\nThis is a significant evolution from earlier versions—you've moved from a \"point-and-tap\" AR app to a continuous perception companion with full-duplex streaming and generative roleplay. The tech stack is ambitious: MiniCPM-o 4.5, Qwen3-VL spatial grounding, MobileLLM-Pro reasoning, and 4-layer spatial audio.\n\n**Next steps:**\n\n1. **Update the project record** with this new phase and description\n2. **Council evaluation** — get multi-perspective scores on technical feasibility, market fit, and revenue path\n3. **Revenue strategy session** — map out how this gets to income (pilot partnerships, B2B licensing, consumer premium?)\n\nWhat's the priority? Do you want the Council to tear into this first, or should we map the path to revenue before validation?",
