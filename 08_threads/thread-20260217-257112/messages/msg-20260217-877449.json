  "content": "Council just came back with a **4.3 out of 10—recommendation is reject**.\n\nThe core issue: your \"invisible companion\" vision requires always-on multimodal processing that would kill the battery in two to three hours and thermally throttle within thirty minutes. That fundamentally breaks the invisible promise.\n\nThey also flagged that the tech stack—MiniCPM-o 4.5, full-duplex VLA, centimeter-precision SLAM—doesn't exist in production-ready form for 2026. You've designed a 2028 research prototype disguised as a 2026 product.\n\n**But here's what they liked:** the underlying insight is solid. Travelers *do* want emotionally resonant historical experiences beyond dry audio tours. That's monetizable.\n\n**Their pivot recommendation:** abandon the always-on ambient model. Instead, do a **trigger-mode enhanced reality experience**—user raises phone to frame a landmark, gets a three-to-five-minute immersive vignette with visual overlay, spatial audio, and character dialogue. User-initiated episodes, not continuous streaming. That solves battery, social friction, and discoverability in one move.\n\nThey also want you to downgrade the tech stack to production-ready 2026 components—Gemini Nano, Whisper V3 Turbo, Stable Diffusion XL on-device—and validate the core assumption with a Wizard-of-Oz prototype before building anything.\n\nWant me to pull the full Council breakdown, or should we move straight to scoping the pivot MVP?",
