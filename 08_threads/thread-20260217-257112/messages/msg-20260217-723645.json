  "content": "I don't see the file in my current view. Let me check the workspace to see if it landed there.\n\nFound it! It's saved as `mirari-aura-prd.md` in the workspace. Let me read it now.\n\nGot it. This is a **comprehensive, well-structured PRD**—Version 5.0 is a significant evolution from the earlier concepts. I can see the \"post-freedom design\" focus: cleaner positioning, tighter scope, clearer revenue model.\n\nLet me save this properly to the project and then we can talk through what I see.\n\nAlright. PRD saved to `projects/mirari-aura/prd-v5.0.md`.\n\nThis is **significantly cleaner** than the earlier iterations. Version 5.0 shows real discipline—you've narrowed scope, clarified the tech stack, and built out credible financial projections. The \"post-freedom design\" framing is accurate: this feels like something you could actually ship, not a concept in search of a product.\n\n**What I see working:**\n\n1. **Clear differentiation** — \"Only product with full-duplex generative historical dialogue + proactive ambient landmark ID + spatial audio\" is a real moat. Nobody else is doing this combination.\n2. **Privacy-first on-device architecture** — Qwen3-VL + MiniCPM-o running locally is a genuine technical advantage and aligns with Swiss values. That's a wedge against Big Tech competitors who stream everything to the cloud.\n3. **Founder-market fit is strong** — This maps perfectly to your skills: multimodal AI, privacy architecture, on-device inference, GDPR compliance.\n4. **B2B hotel licensing provides revenue diversification** — The CHF 200/month per hotel model is smart. If 15 hotels sign on, that's CHF 36K/year baseline even if consumer subscriptions underperform.\n5. **You've done the math** — CHF 3/user/month inference cost covered by CHF 4.99 pro tier is tight but viable. The financial model is honest about the Year 1 loss (CHF -22K) and shows a path to break-even.\n\n**Where I see gaps (and your own note confirms this):**\n\n1. **The hotel B2B model is unvalidated** — You're uncertain about it, and you're right to be. Do hotels actually bundle third-party apps in guest welcome packages? How do they discover/vet partners? What's the procurement process? This needs at least one conversation with a hotel GM or guest experience manager before you commit to it as 25% of your revenue model.\n\n2. **Tourist willingness to pay is unproven** — CHF 4.99/month for a history app is a tough sell when Google Lens is free. The 15% free-to-pro conversion assumption is optimistic for a travel utility app (most convert at 2-5%). If conversion lands at 5%, your pro subscription revenue drops from CHF 44K to CHF 15K, and your Year 1 loss triples.\n\n3. **Distribution risk** — You correctly note that Zürich Tourismus partnership is critical. If they say no, you're dependent on organic App Store discovery in a crowded tourism category. What's your Plan B if the partnership doesn't happen?\n\n4. **iOS development skills** — The PRD lists SwiftUI + Metal as requirements but doesn't clarify whether you have these skills or need to hire. If you need to hire an iOS contractor for 3 months, that's another CHF 15-25K in costs not reflected in the financial model.\n\n5. **Content creation outside your wheelhouse** — Historical research at CHF 5K/city is factored in, but \"hire historical researchers\" is easier said than done. Do you have ETH History Dept contacts? If not, finding and vetting academic partners will slow you down.\n\n6. **Big Tech copy risk** — The Devil's Advocate question is real: What happens when Apple builds this into Maps? Your on-device privacy advantage is temporary—they could ship the same architecture in iOS 19. You need a moat beyond \"we did it first.\"\n\n**Your self-assessment is accurate.** You wrote: *\"I believe the tech is feasible. I'm less certain about distribution.\"* That's the right read. The technical architecture is credible. The business model has 2-3 critical assumptions that need validation before you commit 3 months of full-time work.\n\n**What I'd recommend before Council submission:**\n\n1. **Validate the hotel B2B model** — One conversation with a Zurich hotel (guest experience manager or GM). Ask: \"Would you bundle a CHF 200/month historical companion app in your guest welcome package?\" If yes, what's the procurement process? If no, why not?\n\n2. **Test tourist willingness to pay** — Intercept 10 tourists at Bahnhofstrasse. Show them a mockup of the Mirari concept (even a Figma prototype with spatial audio description). Ask: \"Would you pay CHF 4.99/month for this?\" Track the conversion rate. If it's below 10%, your revenue model needs adjustment.\n\n3. **Clarify iOS dev plan** — Can you ship SwiftUI + Metal yourself, or do you need to hire? If hiring, add CHF 20K to costs. If learning, add 4-6 weeks to timeline.\n\n4. **Get one academic contact** — Reach out to ETH Zurich History Dept. Even a preliminary conversation with one professor would de-risk the content creation assumption.\n\nIf you do those four things, the Council will have real data to work with instead of speculation. The PRD is well-written, but right now it's a hypothesis, not a validated plan.\n\n**Alternative path:** Submit it to the Council now and let them tear it apart. The Devil's Advocate will go hard on the unvalidated assumptions, and you'll get a \"NEEDS INFO\" verdict with a list of questions to answer. That might be faster than doing the pre-work yourself, but it also means you're using the Council as a sounding board instead of a decision gate.\n\nYour call. Do you want to validate the critical assumptions first, or submit it as-is and use the Council feedback to guide your validation work?",
