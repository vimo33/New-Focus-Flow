I saved it to `projects/mirari/prd-v5.0.txt` and gave you the strategic breakdown in my last message.\n\nThe document is Version 5.0, Post-Freedom Design, focused on Zero-UI temporal companion architecture with full-duplex multimodal streaming.\n\n**What I still need from you:**\n\nIs this meant to be a **funded R&D vision** (requiring external capital to build the full stack), or a **bootstrapped MVP** (staged execution toward revenue with a minimal viable slice)?\n\nThat answer determines whether we run a Council evaluation on the full vision or immediately start cutting it down to a fundable/revenue-generating Phase 1.\n\nWhich direction?",
