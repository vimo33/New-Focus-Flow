Here's the honest picture of what I can do for you:\n\n---\n\n**🧠 Think & Plan**\n- Be your strategic sparring partner — challenge ideas, stress-test assumptions, find the holes before the market does\n- Run your ideas through an **AI Council** that scores them on viability, market fit, and execution risk\n\n**📁 Manage Your Portfolio**\n- Track all your projects from concept → deployment\n- Create tasks, set priorities, flag blockers\n- Advance pipelines and generate technical specs\n\n**💰 Track Money**\n- Monitor revenue, costs, and runway\n- Identify income gaps and suggest the fastest path to close them\n- Track your sales deals from lead → closed\n\n**🤝 Manage Relationships**\n- CRM for contacts and deals\n- Surface dormant network connections that could unlock opportunities\n- Draft outreach and follow-ups (with your approval before anything goes out)\n\n**📝 Create Content**\n- Write blog posts, proposals, emails, social posts, marketing copy\n- Manage a content calendar\n\n**📊 Intelligence & Briefings**\n- Generate daily morning briefings with your priorities\n- Weekly performance reports with KPIs and momentum signals\n\n**🔍 Research**\n- Search the web for market data, competitors, pricing, trends\n- Deep search across all your internal data — projects, contacts, deals, memories\n\n**🏥 Wellbeing**\n- Log sleep, mood, energy, focus, stress — and flag when patterns suggest you're burning out\n\n**🗂️ Capture & Inbox**\n- Quick-capture any thought, idea, or task\n- Process and route it to the right place\n\n---\n\nOne rule: anything that touches the outside world — sending emails, making commitments — I'll always confirm with you first. Everything internal, I just do.\n\nWhat do you want to tackle?",
