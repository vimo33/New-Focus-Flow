  "content": "I see the scaffolding of an ambitious portfolio — 18 active projects spanning infrastructure (Kavach AI, FocusFlow OS), creative ventures (Follow the Rabbit, AURA), and platforms (Overture, Multiplium).\n\nRevenue's at 7k/month with zero tracked costs. One closed deal worth $9k. Six pending tasks, mostly validation and evaluation work.\n\nBut my picture has gaps. I'm at 16% profiling completeness — I know project names but not which ones you'd actually bet your year on. I have contact lists but not the relationship depth behind them. I know you're generating revenue but not your expense baseline or what \"comfortable\" looks like for you.\n\nThe critical blind spot: your network. I don't know your top 10 relationships, the Savya partnership dynamics, the Weiterbildung contract terms, or which dormant connections are worth reactivating.\n\nWant to fix that? We could start with financial reality or portfolio priorities — whichever feels more urgent.",
