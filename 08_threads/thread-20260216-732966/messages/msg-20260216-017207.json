The post (what kind of post — a regular engagement, content work, something else?)\n\nIs that the complete list, or are there more streams?\n\nOnce I have all the sources, I need:\n- **The breakdown** across these streams\n- **Monthly expenses** (total outflow)\n- **Any baseline income** beyond the 7k (pension, regular contract, etc.)\n\nKeep going — what's \"the post\"?",
