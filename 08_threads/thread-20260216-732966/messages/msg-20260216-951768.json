  "content": "Understood — the 7k is billable time across the course work and video projects. Not passive, not recurring — you trade hours for income.\n\nThat changes the runway calculation entirely. Active income means if you stop working, revenue stops.\n\nStill need three things to complete the financial picture:\n\n1. **The split**: How much of the 7k comes from course vs. video?\n2. **Monthly expenses**: What goes out each month (rent, food, subscriptions, infrastructure, everything)?\n3. **Baseline income**: Do you have ANY stable income stream (pension, regular contract, spouse income, anything) beyond the 7k billable work, or is project work the entire income?\n\nWhat are those numbers?",
