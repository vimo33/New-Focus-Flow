  "content": "Got it — validate the full vision, then carve strategically. Smart.\n\nThe document is comprehensive and structured well for council review. Before I send it over, one last question to sharpen it:\n\n**What early signals (if any) do you have that this problem is real and urgent for your target users?**\n\nFor example:\n- Conversations with artists about booking friction or commission pain?\n- Venue operators struggling with discovery/payments?\n- Fans wanting closer access to artists?\n- Your own experience in the space?\n\nThe council will ask about demand validation — even anecdotal evidence helps them assess market readiness.",
