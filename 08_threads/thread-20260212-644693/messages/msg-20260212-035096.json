  "content": "Excellent — that's exactly the kind of multi-angle validation that gives a concept real credibility. You're not theorizing; you're synthesizing real pain points you've observed across the ecosystem.\n\n**This concept is ready for the council.**\n\nYou've clearly defined:\n- The problem (fragmented booking, unfair economics, limited artist-fan connection)\n- Target users across multiple sides of the marketplace\n- The solution mechanism (transparent commission-based platform)\n- Differentiation (artist-first, community-driven, fair economics)\n- Validation signals from the field\n\nThe council will be able to give you meaningful feedback on technical feasibility, go-to-market strategy, competitive positioning, architecture, and user experience.\n\n**Should I send this to the council for evaluation?**",
