  "content": "Not natively, no — there's no built-in Google Drive tool in my current setup.\n\n**But here are some options:**\n\n1. **CLI tools** — If you have `rclone` or `gdrive` installed, I can use those via shell commands\n2. **Browser automation** — I can control a browser to access Drive through the web interface (slower, but works)\n3. **MCP servers** — I can check if there's a Model Context Protocol server for Google Drive that we could hook up\n\nWant to explore any of those? Or is this more of a \"nice to have\" vs \"need it now\" thing?\n\n(Also — we still haven't done the whole \"who are you, who am I\" thing. Should we circle back to that, or is Drive access more urgent? 😄)",
