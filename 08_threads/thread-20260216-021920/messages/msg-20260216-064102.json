  "content": "Good morning, Vimo. We need to talk about your portfolio. You have 17 projects, but they're all stuck in concept phase, and there's significant duplication—three versions of AURA, three of the Global Foundation project, and duplicates of Bramha ESG and Focus Flow OS.\n\nBefore we can properly assess what's worth pushing forward, I need your approval to consolidate these duplicates into single coherent projects. This will give us a clearer picture of what you're actually building. After that, we should figure out why nothing's moving past concept—whether it's a resource constraint, decision paralysis, or something else.\n\nKavach AI is your most recent work and Multiplium is the only one showing active progress. Should I start with the duplicate cleanup, or would you rather focus on pushing one of those two forward first?",
