  "content": "Based on the trajectory of your meeting and the \"Overture Bible,\" here are the strategic answers to the outstanding questions, followed by the fully detailed **Overture 2.0 Concept Note**.\n\n### Part 1: Strategic Decisions\n\n*Use these decisions as the \"Rules of Engagement\" for the new platform.*\n\n**1. The Radio Payout: The \"Patronage\" Model**\n\n* **Decision:** Do not use a \"per-stream\" model (like Spotify) because local traffic won't generate enough volume to matter financially, which creates frustration.\n* **The Fix:** Use a **\"Patronage Pool\"** model.\n* Listeners subscribe to Overture Radio for (e.g.) 10 CHF/month.\n* 70% of that money goes into a \"Musician Fund.\"\n* This fund is distributed **not just by streams**, but by **active status** (uploading new tracks, updating availability, responding to messages).\n* *Why:* This gamifies \"staying on the platform.\" If they leave the platform, they lose their monthly \"dividend.\"\n\n\n\n**2. Student Quality Control: The \"Welcome Call\" Gatekeeper**\n\n* **Decision:** Do not rely on automated API checks with universities (too complex). Do not blindly accept everyone.\n* **The Fix:** The **\"onboarding interview\"** mentioned in the transcript is mandatory.\n* **Step 1:** Student signs up with a valid University ID or Portfolio.\n* **Step 2:** Profile is \"Pending.\"\n* **Step 3:** A 15-minute \"Welcome Call\" with a Community Manager (you or a trusted peer).\n* *Why:* This solves two problems: it verifies they are real/competent, and it creates the \"human connection\" that makes them feel guilty about taking bookings off-platform later.\n\n\n\n**3. The Internal Network: Free Utility**\n\n* **Decision:** This must be **100% Free**.\n* **The Fix:** The \"Find a collaborator\" feature is the **retention hook**.\n* If you charge for it, they will just use Facebook Groups.\n* If you make it free and better structured (e.g., \"Search for Cello player in Zurich for Thursday rehearsal\"), they will open the app daily.\n* *Monetization comes from the external bookings, not internal connections.*\n\n\n\n---\n\n### Part 2: The Overture 2.0 Concept Note\n\n*Below is the evolved \"Bible\" ready for your partner and potential developers.*\n\n# Overture: The Live Music Ecosystem\n\n**Current Phase:** Evolution (Post-Concept, Pre-MVP)\n**Region:** Switzerland (Pilot: Zurich & Lausanne)\n**Core Philosophy:** \"Come for the tools, stay for the community, earn through the stage.\"\n\n## 1. Executive Summary\n\nOverture is a digital ecosystem for the local music scene, initially focused on the student-to-professional pipeline in Classical, Jazz, and Acoustic music. Unlike static booking directories, Overture combines a **streaming radio experience** (for discovery) with a **booking marketplace** (for revenue) and a **collaborative network** (for retention).\n\nWe solve the \"Platform Leakage\" problem by providing value that exists *outside* of the transaction: artists stay to be heard on the Radio and to find collaborators, not just to wait for a gig.\n\n## 2. The Three Pillars of Overture\n\n### Pillar A: Overture Radio (The \"Sticky\" Feature)\n\n*A location-based streaming service showcasing local talent.*\n\n* **For the Artist:** They upload their best recordings (demos, concert recaps). This serves as their \"audio business card.\"\n* **For the Listener:** Users subscribe to \"Station Zurich\" or \"Station Lausanne.\" They hear music created by people living in their city.\n* **The Bridge:** While listening, a button appears: **\"Book this Artist.\"** This converts passive listening into active commerce.\n* **Monetization:** Subscription revenue is shared with artists who maintain active profiles.\n\n### Pillar B: The Student-Venue Alliance (The \"Growth\" Engine)\n\n*A B2B service connecting music students with commercial venues.*\n\n* **The Problem:** Students need performance practice; Cafes/Hotels need affordable ambience but hate managing schedules.\n* **The Solution:** The **\"Overture Residency.\"**\n* A venue pays a flat monthly fee (e.g., 400 CHF).\n* Overture guarantees a performer every Friday night (rotating roster of vetted students).\n* Overture handles the scheduling and payments; the venue just provides the space.\n\n\n\n### Pillar C: The Artist Network (The \"Utility\")\n\n*A \"LinkedIn for Musicians\" to facilitate internal collaboration.*\n\n* **Function:** Musicians can post \"Collaboration Calls.\"\n* *Example:* \"Violinist seeking Pianist for a duo exam recital in June.\"\n* *Example:* \"Jazz Trio looking for a sub drummer for next weekend.\"\n\n\n* **Value:** This keeps artists logging in daily, even when they aren't getting booked by clients.\n\n## 3. User Experience (UX) Flow\n\n**The Artist Journey (Student Focused)**\n\n1. **Sign Up:** Uploads Student ID and \"Audio Portfolio.\"\n2. **The Welcome Call:** A 15-min video chat with an Overture Community Manager to verify skills and explain the \"Community Code.\"\n3. **Active Status:** Artist creates a profile and uploads tracks to **Overture Radio**.\n4. **Internal Use:** Uses the search filter to find a cellist for a school project.\n5. **The Gig:** Receives a notification: \"You have been requested for a Friday Residency at Cafe Odéon.\"\n6. **Payment:** Automatic payout post-gig (minus commission).\n\n**The Client Journey (Venue/Private)**\n\n1. **Discovery:** Tunes into \"Overture Radio Zurich\" while working.\n2. **Connection:** Hears a guitar piece they like. Clicks **\"View Profile.\"**\n3. **Booking:**\n* *Option A (Private):* \"Book for Dinner Party\" (One-off).\n* *Option B (Venue):* \"Subscribe to Weekly Music\" (Recurring).\n\n\n4. **Transaction:** Pays via platform to ensure contract security.\n\n## 4. Business Model & Monetization\n\n| Revenue Stream | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| **1. Booking Commission** | **10-15%** fee on all private gigs booked through the platform. (Includes insurance/contract handling). |\n| **2. Venue Subscriptions** | Recurring B2B revenue from cafes/restaurants for \"Managed Entertainment\" packages. |\n| **3. Fan Subscriptions** | Monthly fee (approx. 9 CHF) for ad-free Overture Radio. Proceeds split between Platform (30%) and Artist Pool (70%). |\n\n## 5. Development Phases (Roadmap)\n\n**Phase 1: The \"Manual\" MVP (Months 1-3)**\n\n* **Tech:** Simple website (Webflow/WordPress). No automated radio yet.\n* **Action:**\n* Recruit 20 High-Quality Students (The \"Founding Members\").\n* Secure 3 Venues for weekly rotations.\n* \"Radio\" is simply a curated Soundcloud playlist embedded on the site.\n* **Goal:** Prove the \"Student-Venue\" economy works manually.\n\n\n\n**Phase 2: The Platform Build (Months 4-9)**\n\n* **Tech:** Custom app with Audio Player and Booking Calendar.\n* **Action:**\n* Implement the \"Internal Network\" search.\n* Automate the booking payments (Stripe Connect).\n* Begin the \"Welcome Call\" process for wider student onboarding.\n\n\n\n**Phase 3: The Ecosystem (Year 1+)**\n\n* **Tech:** Algorithmic Radio (music based on listener taste).\n* **Action:**\n* Expansion to Geneva/Basel.\n* \"Digital Museum\" features (archiving Swiss music heritage).\n\n\n\n## 6. The \"Anti-Goals\" (What we are NOT doing yet)\n\n* **We are NOT** building a complex copyright database for music history (too expensive/legal heavy).\n* **We are NOT** exclusively Classical. We are \"High-Quality Acoustic\" (Jazz, Folk, Classical).\n* **We are NOT** a generic \"Gig Economy\" site (like Fiverr for music). We are a vetted community.",
