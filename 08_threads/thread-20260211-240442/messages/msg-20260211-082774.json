  "content": "We are self funded, we will use AI tools to build the MVP get ttraction and look for grants or funding. Focus for us to build the ecosystem. Maybe we even go the nt for profit way if that makes sense. I have connections to music students and music schools so we could find a soultion for the cold start for sure.

Me founder creative technologist Vikas, Francesco classical guitar teacher in a music school and profesional musician. Mira music student and curator with a active network of music students from ZhDk. Answer the rest of the questions based on your expertise and reasoning.",
