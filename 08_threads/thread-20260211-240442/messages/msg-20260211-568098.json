Radio (discovery layer) = unique\n2. Patronage Pool = better retention than commission-only\n3. Welcome Call = quality curation competitors can't scale\n4. Local-first = we own the Zurich/Lausanne relationships\n```\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Go-to-Market Strategy (The Cold Start Problem)**\n\n**What's Missing:**\n- How do you get the **first 20 founding artists** without a track record?\n- How do you get the **first 3 venues** to trust you with their Friday nights?\n\n**What to Define:**\n```\nPhase 1 Acquisition:\n- Artists: Direct outreach to ZHdK/HEMU department heads for \"pilot cohort\"\n- Venues: Offer first 3 months free (or 50% discount) to early adopter cafes\n- Social Proof: Partner with 1 respected music professor as \"Artistic Advisor\"\n```\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Team & Governance**\n\n**What's Missing:**\n- Who builds the tech?
