  "content": "## Recommended Distribution Formula\n\nA **multi-factor weighted system** that balances listener value with platform participation:\n\n### The Formula (Monthly Pool Split)\n\n**40% - Listener Engagement Score**\n- Streams weighted by completion rate (skip after 10 seconds = 0.1 credit, full listen = 1.0 credit)\n- \"Book this Artist\" clicks from Radio = 5x multiplier\n- Profile views from Radio player\n\n*Why:* This rewards what listeners actually value. Prevents upload spam because bad tracks get skipped.\n\n**30% - Booking Activity Score**\n- Accepted bookings (even if initiated off-platform, they report it)\n- Response time to booking requests (< 24hrs = full credit)\n- Profile completeness (calendar updated, pricing current)\n\n*Why:* Rewards the commercial behavior you want. If they're actively working, they stay engaged.\n\n**20% - Base Participation**\n- Minimum 1 track uploaded in last 90 days\n- Profile active (not \"paused\")\n- Equal share among all qualifying artists\n\n*Why:* Creates a \"floor\" so new/niche artists don't get zero. Prevents complete winner-take-all dynamics.\n\n**10% - Community Contribution**\n- Collaboration posts in the Network\n- Helping others (responding to collab requests)\n- Attendance at Overture events (if you host meetups)\n\n*Why:* Rewards the \"glue\" behavior that builds community beyond transactions.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Safeguards\n\n1. **Quality Gate:** Artists must pass the Welcome Call to enter the pool at all\n2. **Decay Function:** Scores decay weekly (20% per week). Prevents \"upload once, earn forever\"\n3. **Cap on Uploads:** Max 3 new tracks per month count toward engagement (prevents spam)\n4. **Transparency Dashboard:** Every artist sees their exact score breakdown monthly\n\n---\n\n### Example (Swiss Context)\n\n*100 subscribers × 10 CHF × 70% = 700 CHF/month artist pool*\n\n**Artist A** (established, high streams):\n- Engagement: 15% of total streams → 42 CHF\n- Booking: 3 gigs, fast response → 31.50 CHF\n- Base: Active → 14 CHF (700×20%÷100 artists)\n- Community: 1 collab post → 7 CHF\n- **Total: 94.50 CHF**\n\n**Artist B** (new, niche genre):\n- Engagement: 0.5% of streams → 1.40 CHF\n- Booking: No gigs yet → 0 CHF\n- Base: Active → 14 CHF\n- Community: Active in network → 10 CHF\n- **Total: 25.40 CHF**\n\nNotice Artist B still gets ~25 CHF/month just for being active. That's enough to feel valued while they build reputation.\n\n---\n\n**The Psychology:** Artists understand they're not \"paid per stream\" (Spotify frustration), but they're \"shareholders in a local co-op\" where staying active = monthly dividend. Very different mental model.\n\nDoes this framework align with your vision for community-first monetization?",
