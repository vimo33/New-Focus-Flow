Keeps mission intact while allowing investment.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Competitive Moat (Why You'll Win)**\n\n**1. The \"Community Capture\" Advantage:**\n- Competitors (Gigmit, Musiker-plattform.ch) are transactional. You're relational.\n- Mira's ZHdK network = built-in trust. Students recruit their peers.\n- Francesco's teaching role = direct pipeline from lesson room to platform.\n\n**2. The Radio Differentiator:**\n- No Swiss competitor has a discovery layer. They're all \"search and book.\"\n- Radio creates passive engagement (listeners become clients without searching).\n\n**3. Quality Curation:**\n- Welcome Call = barrier to entry that scales through student volunteers.\n- Competitors can't replicate this without hiring staff (you're using social capital).\n\n**4. Local-First:**\n- You own Zurich relationships. National platforms are too broad to compete at city-level intimacy.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Risk Mitigation (Detailed)**\n\n| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |\n|------|------------|--------|------------|\n| **Platform Leakage** (artists go direct after first gig) | High | High | Patronage Pool + Internal Network makes staying valuable even without bookings. Track \"off-platform repeat rate\" - if >30%, add penalty (lose pool access for 3 months). |\n| **Student Volunteers Burn Out** | Medium | High | Cap volunteer hours at 5/week. Create \"Ambassador Levels\" with perks (free concert tickets, platform credit). Rotate responsibilities every semester. |\n| **Venue Demand Too Low** | Medium | High | Pre-validate with Francesco's existing venue contacts. Start with 3 venues that already book him - expand from proof points. If <2 renew, pivot to private events only. |\n| **SUISA Licensing Complexity** | Low | Medium | Research: In Switzerland, venues pay SUISA directly for \"background music\" rights. Your artists perform originals or public domain → no platform liability. Clarify in artist agreement. If covers, venue's existing license covers it. |\n| **Mira/Francesco Leave Project** | Low | Critical | Formalize equity/rev-share early. Mira gets 10% of net revenue as Community Lead. Francesco gets 5% + advisory role. Vesting over 2 years. |\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Success Metrics (Phase 1)**\n\n**Month 3 Milestones (Manual MVP):**\n- ✅ 15 vetted artists (Mira's network + ZHdK recruitment)\n- ✅ 3 venue partnerships locked (Francesco's contacts)\n- ✅ 30+ hours of live performances delivered\n- ✅ Radio playlist live with 20+ tracks\n\n**Month 6 (Platform Launch):**\n- ✅ 50 active artist profiles\n- ✅ 100+ Radio listeners (organic growth)\n- ✅ 5 venues on recurring contracts\n- ✅ CHF 2,000 in booking revenue (proof of commercial viability)\n- ✅ 1 grant application submitted with traction data\n\n**Kill Criteria:**\n- If <10 students complete Welcome Call after outreach to 3 music schools → talent pool doesn't exist\n- If 0 venues book a second month → value prop broken (pivot to private events or corporate)\n\n---\n\n### 6. **Team Roles & Governance**\n\n```\nCore Team:\n\nVikas (Founder/CEO) - 60% equity\n- Product vision & AI-assisted platform development\n- Grant applications & partnership strategy\n- Final decision authority\n\nFrancesco (Artistic Director) - 15% equity\n- Venue relationship management\n- Artist Welcome Calls (quality control)\n- Curriculum integration (recruit through teaching)\n\nMira (Community Lead) - 15% equity\n- Student recruitment & onboarding\n- Radio curation & social media\n- Ambassador program coordination\n\nStudent Ambassadors (10% equity pool) - Rev-share tiers\n- Tier 1 (5 students): 1% each - run Welcome Calls, manage bookings\n- Tier 2 (10 students): 0.5% each - content creation, event support\n```\n\n**Decision Framework:**\n- Operations: Mira decides (student-facing)\n- Artistic: Francesco decides (quality/venues)\n- Strategy: Vikas decides (product/funding)\n- Major pivots: Majority vote of 3 core members\n\n---\n\n### 7. **Grant Strategy (Swiss Context)**\n\n**Target Grants for Phase 1:**\n\n**1.
