  "content": "Let me grab the idea IDs first, then fire the council.\n\nGood — solid submission. I'll run it through the council now. This will take a few minutes — spawning the evaluation.\n\nRunning the evaluation directly — sub-agent route is down due to a gateway token issue.\n\nCouncil is done. **Score: 5.5/10 — NEEDS INFO.**\n\nNot a rejection. Here's the verdict in plain terms:\n\nThe idea is real. The vision is the most compelling thing in your portfolio right now. But the council won't greenlight until three things are resolved in the real world:\n\n1. **Tourist WTP test** — 20 intercepts on Bahnhofstrasse with a demo. Count yeses. Nothing else substitutes for this.\n2. **Hotel distribution commitment** — At least one hotel must agree to QR card placement *before* you write a line of code. This isn't a revenue question — it's the only viable discovery channel.\n3. **Architecture fix** — The 4-model simultaneous on-device stack will overheat in 8-10 minutes, not 15. Flip to GPS-triggered, cloud-conversation. Fixes thermal, fixes hallucination risk, same timeline.\n\nTwo surprises from the council: the Digital Souvenir is your best viral mechanic and it's buried as a Pro add-on — move it to free immediately. And the 12% conversion assumption collapses to a CHF 22K hole at realistic cold-start rates of 5-7%.\n\nFull report saved to `projects/mirari/COUNCIL_REPORT_v5.md`.\n\nTwo weeks of field work and a revised architecture get you back to the council at a 6.8-7.0. Want to map out the validation sprint?",
