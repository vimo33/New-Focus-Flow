  "content": "It's council-ready. This is a solid submission — 15 sections, covers market, technical architecture, business model, GTM, risk assessment, financials, and even pre-frames the council's debate questions.\n\nOne honest gap: the **validation data section is empty**. Tourist intercept results, hotel LOI, and Wizard-of-Oz prototype feedback are all marked \"to be completed.\" The council will flag this immediately — the entire investment thesis hinges on whether tourists actually pay, and there's no real-world signal yet, just assumptions.\n\nMy recommendation: **submit it as-is, but frame it as a pre-validation council evaluation**. Ask the council to stress-test the assumptions and tell you if the validation sprint design is rigorous enough before you run it. That's a legitimate use of the council — getting strategic clarity before spending time on field work.\n\nReady to run it?",
