  "content": "Good. Running the council evaluation now against COUNCIL_SUBMISSION_v5.md.\n\nCouncil has delivered. Here's the verdict:\n\n**6.0/10 — NEEDS INFO**\n\nFive voices, five angles. The headline findings:\n\n**What they agreed on:**\n- Don't build anything until validation sprint is done — Wizard of Oz prototype + tourist intercept are hard gates\n- Two model names in your tech stack (MobileLLM-Pro P1, NeuTTS-Nano) aren't confirmable — replace with real alternatives\n- Your 12% free-to-pro conversion is optimistic; at 8% (industry reality for tourist apps), Year 1 is a CHF ~15K loss, not CHF 1.8K\n- Kill 3–4 portfolio projects before Mirari gets any time allocation\n\n**What they debated:**\n- Devil's Advocate raised the sharpest question: has *any* tourist app solved the attention problem, and does generative experience actually fix it? The Detour/Gable graveyard is worth studying\n- Financial Auditor suggests modeling a free app + Zürich Tourismus sponsorship (CHF 50K/year) as an alternative to B2C subscription — removes App Store friction entirely\n\n**Path forward:**\nTwo-week validation sprint, 5 gates. If 3+ pass → MVP. If not → revise or kill.\n\nFull evaluation saved to `projects/mirari/COUNCIL_EVALUATION_v5.md`.\n\nOne question the council is waiting on from you: what 3 projects from the portfolio of 19 are you willing to kill or shelf if Mirari gets the greenlight? That's the prerequisite the council won't waive.",
