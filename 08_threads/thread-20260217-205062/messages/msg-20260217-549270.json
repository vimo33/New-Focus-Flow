  "content": "Let me read the full council package and then spawn the evaluation.\n\nCouncil evaluation is complete — the package was pre-generated with full agent verdicts. Here's the result:\n\n---\n\n**MIRARI — COUNCIL VERDICT**\nScore: **6.0 / 10** | Recommendation: **NEEDS INFO**\n\n| Agent | Score | Key Issue |\n|-------|-------|-----------|\n| Market Analyst | 6/10 | Demand proven, willingness-to-pay unvalidated |\n| Technical Architect | 7/10 | Feasible, but 5-system integration = high risk |\n| Financial Strategist | 5/10 | 84% of costs = inference. Hotel B2B untested |\n| Founder-Market Fit | 7/10 | Tech alignment strong, GTM is the gap |\n| Strategic Devil's Advocate | 5/10 | Cool demo, unclear moat vs. Apple/Google |\n\n---\n\n**What tips it to APPROVE:** 3 things.\n1. Prototype test — 60%+ of tourists say they'd pay CHF 4.99/month\n2. One hotel LOI — proves B2B model isn't theoretical\n3. PoC latency — Grossmünster demo at <2s end-to-end\n\n**What kills it:** Zero tourist intercepts say yes. Hotel cold outreach hits silence. iPhone thermal-throttles under full inference load.\n\n**The council's real provocation:** Is a 6-month runway to first revenue worth it, given your current CHF 7K/month baseline and the \"income first\" directive? Multiplium and bootcamps both generate revenue faster.\n\n**Recommended next step:** 2-week validation sprint, CHF 2K budget. Week 1 builds the Grossmünster PoC. Week 2 runs tourist intercepts. Decision point at end of Week 2.\n\nWhat's your call — run the sprint, or is there a faster-revenue project that should take priority right now?",
