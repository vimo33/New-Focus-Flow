Major revisions include: a comprehensive Trust and Safety protocol (Section 5), a single-city phased launch replacing the 4-city simultaneous strategy (Section 3), radically simplified beta governance (Section 8), economic sustainability safeguards against PWYW decay (Section 6), a formal dispute resolution and facilitator removal process (Section 7), cross-cultural adaptation framework (Section 4), and integration of Reinventing Organizations Teal principles throughout.\n\n\nPhased Launch: Zurich (Primary)  →  Bangalore  →  Goa  →  San Francisco\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n1. Organizational Philosophy: Teal Principles\nThis Foundation is designed as a Teal organization in the framework articulated by Frédéric Laloux in Reinventing Organizations. Teal organizations are built on three foundational breakthroughs: self-management, wholeness, and evolutionary purpose. Every structural decision in this document is evaluated against these three pillars.\n1.1 Self-Management\nThere is no hierarchical command structure. City nodes, facilitator communities, and participant groups self-organize within the protocol framework. Decision-making is distributed: anyone can make any decision after seeking advice from those who will be meaningfully affected and those with relevant expertise. This is the Advice Process, borrowed from Teal organizations like Buurtzorg and FAVI, where it has been proven at scale. The Foundation does not have managers who approve or reject decisions. Instead, it has clear processes, transparent information, and peer accountability.\n1.2 Wholeness\nThe platform exists to enable people to show up as their full selves: emotional, intuitive, physical, spiritual, vulnerable. This is not just a values statement; it has concrete design implications. The Trust and Safety Protocol in Section 5 creates the conditions for psychological safety. The conflict resolution process in Section 7 uses restorative rather than punitive approaches. The governance system is designed so that participation does not require professional-class engagement, respecting that most people come to this platform to have embodied experiences, not to manage digital systems. The platform should require the minimum digital engagement necessary to enable maximum physical togetherness.\nCouncil Response — Physical-Digital Integration (previously 6/10): \nThe council identified that governance complexity and transparency maximalism create sustained digital engagement pressure that contradicts the physical-first mission. This version introduces the principle of Minimum Viable Digital: every digital feature must justify itself by the physical gathering it enables. Governance is radically simplified for beta. The 24-hour settlement window no longer features a real-time dashboard (replaced by a single summary notification). Karma decay is extended to 180-day half-life, reducing check-in pressure.\n\n1.3 Evolutionary Purpose\nThe Foundation does not have a fixed strategic plan imposed from above. It listens to what the community needs and evolves accordingly. The constitutional framework in Section 9 embeds this through its layered amendment process and the explicit principle that scope evolves based on lived experience, not top-down vision. The phased launch strategy in Section 3 is an expression of evolutionary purpose: start small, learn deeply, expand only when the community’s lived practice reveals what comes next.\n1.4 Truly Human Leadership\nThe fourth philosophical pillar draws from Bob Chapman’s Truly Human Leadership framework, developed over 25 years at Barry-Wehmiller and codified through the Chapman & Co. Leadership Institute. Chapman’s central insight, articulated in the Wall Street Journal bestseller Everybody Matters, is deceptively simple: “We measure success by the way we touch the lives of people.” This is not a platitude; it is a measurable standard that has scaled across a $3.6 billion company with 12,000 team members and 150+ acquisitions spanning multiple countries and cultures.\nThe relevance to this Foundation is direct and structural. Chapman demonstrated that a people-centric approach is not in tension with organizational performance but is in fact its prerequisite. Barry-Wehmiller’s results prove this: Meijer saw a 25% decrease in employee turnover after adopting the framework; American Airlines applied the principles across 130,000 team members; the approach has been validated in a Harvard Business School case study taught at 70+ institutions. The Foundation adopts four specific Chapman & Co. principles as design inputs.\nPrinciple 1 — Listening Without Judgment: Chapman identifies empathetic listening as the single most important leadership skill. The Listen Like a Leader training, delivered to over 20,000 people through the Chapman Foundation for Caring Communities in hospitals, police departments, schools, and nonprofits, teaches that genuine listening requires suspending the impulse to fix, advise, or correct. This principle is embedded in the platform’s facilitator training (Section 5.1), conflict resolution process (Section 7), and community ambassador onboarding. Every person in a leadership role on the platform—facilitators, ambassadors, governance participants—learns structured empathetic listening.\nPrinciple 2 — Recognizing Goodness in Others: Chapman teaches that recognition is a skill, not a natural instinct. People must be trained to see and celebrate the contributions of others in thoughtful, timely ways. The platform’s facilitator advancement system (Section 12) is designed around this: tier progression requires nomination from community members who have recognized a facilitator’s contribution. The post-event feedback system is oriented toward recognizing what went well, not just flagging problems. Quarterly impact storytelling (Section 6.2) is a structured recognition practice for the entire community.\nPrinciple 3 — From Me-Centric to We-Centric: Chapman describes the fundamental leadership transformation as moving from self-interest to service. This maps precisely to the Foundation’s economic model: facilitators succeed not by maximizing extraction but by creating value that the community voluntarily reciprocates. The sliding-scale model, the community fund, and the surplus redistribution system all encode we-centric economics. The governance system encodes we-centric power: one member, one voice, no wealth-based advantages.\nPrinciple 4 — Culture Scales Through Leadership, Not Rules: Barry-Wehmiller’s most remarkable achievement is maintaining a coherent culture across 150+ acquisitions in multiple countries. They did not accomplish this through policy manuals or compliance systems. They accomplished it by developing leaders who embody the culture and by investing in a corporate university (Barry-Wehmiller University) that teaches human skills. The Foundation applies this insight directly: culture is transmitted through facilitator mentorship and co-facilitation, not through rule enforcement. The constitutional framework (Section 9) provides guardrails, but the living culture is carried by people, not documents. Ambassador selection, facilitator onboarding, and community gathering design are all culture-transmission mechanisms.\nChapman & Co. Integration Note: \n95% of feedback from people learning Truly Human Leadership was not about business metrics—it was about how the skills transformed their marriages, relationships with children, and capacity to care at home. This ripple effect is the Foundation’s thesis: when people experience genuine community, transparent economics, and trust in physical gatherings, the effects radiate into their broader lives. The platform does not just organize events; it teaches people how to show up for each other.\n\n\n2. Problem Statement and Vision\n2.1 The Problem\nImmersive collective gatherings such as ecstatic dance, sound journeys, breathwork circles, and conscious raves are growing in cultural relevance globally. Yet this movement operates in a fragmented ecosystem lacking standardized financial transparency, ethical oversight and accountability, defined governance structures, formalized community feedback systems, trust signals for participants, and critically, participant safety infrastructure for practices that can be psychologically and physically intense.\nThis fragmentation creates compounding risks: opacity around where money goes, power concentration among charismatic facilitators without accountability, ethical ambiguity in vulnerable settings, erosion of trust as participation scales, and the potential for real harm in consciousness-altering practices conducted without adequate safety protocols.\n2.2 The Core Insight\nThe digital world has been pulling physical communities into virtual spaces. This platform inverts that dynamic: it uses digital infrastructure to strengthen and scale physical community gathering. Nothing on this platform is virtual. Everything leads to people being in the same room together. The platform’s digital layer should be as thin as possible while still providing the coordination, transparency, and safety infrastructure that physical gatherings need to operate at scale with trust.\n\n3. Phased Launch Strategy\nCouncil Response — Cross-Cultural Coordination (previously 4/10): \nThe council unanimously identified the 4-city simultaneous launch as operationally reckless. The 5–6x purchasing power disparity, conflicting cultural norms around transparency and privacy, different legal/regulatory environments, and manual verification across time zones create non-comparable data and fragile operations. This version replaces the simultaneous launch with a phased single-city validation strategy.\n\n3.1 Phase 1: Zurich Deep Validation (Months 1–6)\nZurich is selected as the primary validation city because Switzerland’s high-trust society and embedded direct democracy culture are most naturally aligned with the platform’s transparency and governance model. This creates the best possible conditions for initial assumption testing. If the model fails in Zurich, it will likely fail everywhere. If it succeeds, the question becomes how to adapt it for different cultural contexts.\nDuring this phase, all core experiments run using manual tools: Google Forms for registration, WhatsApp for community coordination, Google Sheets for transparent cost tracking, and in-person events for actual gatherings. No technology is built. The goal is to run 15–20 events testing sliding-scale economics, facilitator acceptance, transparency effects on payment behavior, governance participation rates, and platform discovery value. The complete experiment framework is detailed in Section 11.\nThe Zurich phase also develops and tests the complete Trust and Safety Protocol (Section 5) with real participants and facilitators, establishing the safety baseline before any expansion.\n3.2 Phase 2: Contrasting Culture Expansion — Bangalore (Months 7–12)\nBangalore is selected as the second city specifically because it contrasts with Zurich on every dimension the council flagged: price sensitivity versus high-trust surplus payment, collectivist community versus individualist transparency norms, privacy expectations around financial disclosure, and the presence of dense physical communities like Brigade apartment complexes. Launching in Bangalore second, not simultaneously, means every cultural tension is surfaced in a controlled comparison rather than lost in noise from four simultaneous experiments.\nBangalore requires its own sliding-scale range calibrated to local purchasing power, culturally adapted payment timing (possibly cash-friendly options alongside digital), and adapted governance formats that respect local decision-making culture while maintaining core protocol principles. These adaptations are documented as a Cultural Adaptation Playbook during this phase.\n3.3 Phase 3: Third and Fourth City (Months 13–18)\nGoa and San Francisco are added only after the Zurich–Bangalore comparison has revealed which platform assumptions are universal and which are culturally specific. Goa introduces unique challenges: a tourist economy with dual-pricing norms that directly conflict with the transparency ethos, seasonal demand cycles, and a transient-versus-resident population split. San Francisco has the largest existing conscious events community and tech-savvy early adopters. Each city launches with a complete Cultural Adaptation Playbook based on learnings from the first two phases, its own sliding-scale ranges, and locally hired community ambassadors.\n3.4 Legal and Regulatory Adaptation\nEach city requires separate legal analysis. Swiss nonprofit law, US 501(c)(3) structures, Indian Society Registration Act, and Goan state-level regulations differ fundamentally. Tax implications for facilitator payments, community fund management, and cross-border transfers vary wildly. The Foundation establishes a primary legal entity in Switzerland (aligned with the Zurich primary launch) and creates affiliate structures in each subsequent jurisdiction. Legal setup is completed before the relevant city launches, not retrospectively.\n\n4. Cross-Cultural Adaptation Framework\nThe council correctly identified that a single global model cannot translate uniformly across cultures with fundamentally different norms around transparency, hierarchy, pricing, consent, and financial privacy. This section establishes what is universal protocol (non-negotiable) versus what is locally adaptable.\nDimension\nUniversal Protocol (Non-Negotiable)\nLocally Adaptable\nFinancial transparency\nAll event costs are disclosed to participants post-event; facilitator compensation structure is public\nSliding-scale range, currency, payment timing (pre/post), cash versus digital options, how disclosure is presented\nSafety protocols\nTrust and Safety Protocol (Section 5) applies in full everywhere; incident reporting is always independent of facilitator networks\nSpecific consent language and cultural framing; emergency contact numbers; local professional referral networks\nFacilitator verification\nScreening, trial event, and co-facilitation requirements; trauma-informed training baseline\nAmbassador selection criteria adapted to local professional networks; verification conversation language and format\nGovernance participation\nAll active members have equal governance rights regardless of financial contribution\nDecision-making format (consensus vs. consent vs. majority); meeting structure; communication channel preferences\nSurplus redistribution\nPredefined transparent redistribution rules; community fund exists in every city\nExact percentages within defined ranges; how community fund is allocated locally; which local causes it supports\nConsent culture\nExplicit informed consent required for all consciousness-altering practices; touch is always opt-in\nCultural framing of consent conversations; language and terminology; degree of formality in consent process\nPricing\nSliding scale is offered at every paid event; no participant is turned away for inability to pay\nScale range calibrated to local purchasing power; anchor price; scholarship mechanisms\n\n\nThe Cultural Adaptation Playbook for each city is developed collaboratively with local ambassadors and a founding cohort of 5–10 local facilitators during the pre-launch phase. It documents how each universal protocol element is implemented in the local cultural context and is reviewed quarterly for the first year.\nChapman & Co. Insight — Universal Values, Local Expression: \nBarry-Wehmiller operates in 28 countries with 150+ acquired companies, each with its own pre-existing culture. Their experience proves that ‘once people in various cultures come to understand it, the human value expressed in the Truly Human Leadership approach is a universally accepted standard. There is a shared human longing to be valued, supported, to be in charge of the scope and methods in work, and to develop and learn.’ However, BW does not impose a uniform cultural template. They ‘work hard to embrace the unique culture of each acquisition and respect the history of each organization.’ The Foundation applies the same principle: the desire for transparency, safety, genuine community, and fair economics is universal, but how these values are expressed—the language of consent, the format of financial disclosure, the style of governance meetings—must be locally authentic. The Cultural Adaptation Playbook is the mechanism for honoring both.\n\n\n5. Trust and Safety jProtocol\nCouncil Response — Trust & Safety (previously 4/10): \nThe council identified this as the most critical gap in v2. The 41,000-character document dedicated extraordinary detail to token economics but was alarmingly vague on participant protection in vulnerable settings. There was no incident reporting mechanism independent of facilitator networks, no trauma-informed training requirements, no informed consent protocols for consciousness-altering practices, no contraindications screening, no emergency response protocols, and no facilitator removal process. This section is entirely new and must be developed BEFORE any technical build or public launch.\n\nThis platform operates in intimate, psychologically and physically intense environments. Breathwork can trigger trauma responses, dissociation, and panic attacks. Sound healing can induce altered states of consciousness. Movement practices involve physical proximity and sometimes contact. The Trust and Safety Protocol is not a feature; it is the foundation upon which everything else is built. If this section is not implemented correctly, the platform should not launch.\n5.1 Trauma-Informed Facilitator Training Requirements\nEvery facilitator on the platform, at any verification tier, must complete a baseline training module covering the following competencies before running their first event. This is non-negotiable and applies globally.\nCompetency Area\nMinimum Requirement\nVerification Method\nTrauma-informed facilitation\nUnderstanding of nervous system regulation (polyvagal theory basics), recognition of trauma activation signs (dissociation, hyperarousal, emotional flooding), and de-escalation techniques\nCompletion of platform-approved training module (8–12 hours); practical assessment during trial event\nContraindications awareness\nKnowledge of when specific practices should be modified or avoided: cardiovascular conditions and intense breathwork, pregnancy and certain movement practices, psychiatric medication interactions with consciousness-altering practices, recent surgery or injury\nWritten acknowledgment of contraindications checklist; demonstrated screening in trial event\nInformed consent protocols\nAbility to deliver clear, non-coercive informed consent briefings before every session; understanding that consent is ongoing and can be withdrawn at any time\nObserved consent delivery during trial event; participant feedback on clarity\nEmergency response basics\nKnowledge of grounding techniques for psychological crises (panic attacks, dissociative episodes, trauma flashbacks); when and how to escalate to professional support\nPractical scenario assessment during co-facilitation\nBoundary ethics\nClear understanding of power dynamics in facilitation; appropriate touch protocols (always opt-in, never assumed); dual relationship awareness\nScreening conversation with community ambassador; ongoing community feedback\n\n\nThe platform partners with established training bodies such as the Global Professional Breathwork Alliance (GPBA), local somatic therapy associations, and trauma-informed facilitation networks to develop and deliver this training. The training module is reviewed and updated annually based on incident data and evolving best practices. Existing certified facilitators from recognized bodies (GPBA, IABF, local equivalents) may receive credit for prior training, but must still complete the platform-specific consent and emergency response modules.\n5.2 Informed Consent Framework\nEvery event on the platform that involves consciousness-altering practices (breathwork, intense sound healing, deep movement work) must include the following informed consent elements delivered to participants before the session begins.\nThe facilitator must provide a clear description of what the practice involves and what participants may experience, including the possibility of intense emotions, physical sensations, altered consciousness, and trauma activation. The facilitator must name specific contraindications and ask participants to self-assess, including cardiovascular conditions, pregnancy, psychiatric medication, recent trauma, and epilepsy. The facilitator must explain that participation is voluntary at every moment: anyone can stop, slow down, or leave at any time without explanation and without social pressure. The facilitator must describe available support: who is designated as a safety holder during the session, what grounding support is available, and how to signal distress. Finally, the facilitator must explain the touch protocol: whether any touch is involved in the practice, that all touch is opt-in through clear verbal or physical signaling (such as a colored bracelet system), and that consent can be withdrawn at any time.\nFor events involving practices that do not alter consciousness (painting workshops, community cooking, outdoor movement), a simplified consent framework applies: clear description of the activity, any physical demands, and the opt-out principle.\n5.3 Independent Incident Reporting\nThis is the single most critical infrastructure element identified by the council. Someone harmed by a Distinguished facilitator must not be required to report through systems that elevated that person. The incident reporting mechanism operates independently from the facilitator network, the community ambassador network, and the platform’s governance structures.\nThe system works as follows. Any participant can submit an incident report through a dedicated, clearly visible channel on the platform that bypasses all community and facilitator structures. Reports can be submitted anonymously if the reporter chooses. Reports are received by an independent Trust and Safety Panel composed of individuals who are not active facilitators on the platform. The panel includes at minimum one trauma-informed professional (therapist, counselor, or equivalent), one legal or mediation professional, and one community member who serves a fixed, non-renewable term. The panel acknowledges receipt within 48 hours and initiates an investigation process within 7 days. The investigation process includes confidential interviews with the reporter, the facilitator, and any witnesses; review of any relevant event documentation; and a determination ranging from no action through to temporary suspension, mandatory retraining, or permanent removal.\nThe Trust and Safety Panel operates at the global protocol level, not the city level, to prevent local social dynamics from influencing outcomes. Its decisions override city-level governance. Panel members are nominated by the Foundation and confirmed by community vote, with staggered terms to ensure continuity. Its proceedings are confidential but its aggregate reporting (number of reports, categories, outcomes) is published annually as part of the Foundation’s transparency commitments.\n5.4 Emergency Response Protocols\nEvery event on the platform must designate at least one Safety Holder in addition to the lead facilitator. For events with 15 or more participants, a second Safety Holder is required. For events involving consciousness-altering practices regardless of size, a Safety Holder is required separate from the facilitator so that the facilitator can focus on holding space while the Safety Holder monitors participants.\nSafety Holders are trained in grounding techniques for psychological crises: verbal grounding (naming five things you can see), physical grounding (feeling feet on the floor, holding a warm object), breath regulation (slow extended exhalations), and containment (creating a quiet, low-stimulation space for someone in distress). Critically, Safety Holders are also trained in empathetic listening drawn from Chapman & Co.’s Listen Like a Leader methodology: when a participant is in distress, the first response is not to fix or advise but to listen without judgment. Chapman’s research across 20,000 people in hospitals, schools, and nonprofits demonstrates that empathetic listening is the single most effective de-escalation skill, and that it must be taught—it is not intuitive. Safety Holders practice the Listen Like a Leader protocol during their training: full presence, no interrupting, reflecting back what they hear, and only then asking what support the person needs. They know when to escalate: if a participant shows signs of severe dissociation, suicidal ideation, psychotic symptoms, or medical emergency, the Safety Holder contacts emergency services and the Trust and Safety Panel. Every event listing includes a visible Emergency Contact section with local emergency numbers, the nearest hospital, and a mental health crisis line appropriate to the city.\n5.5 Facilitator Safety Transparency\nThe council noted that financial transparency is emphasized extensively but safety and consent transparency is absent. This version requires every facilitator marketplace profile to include their completed training certifications (platform module plus any external accreditations), the date of their most recent training or refresher, their insurance status if applicable, and their aggregate safety record on the platform: number of events facilitated, number of incident reports received, and outcomes. This last element is published as aggregate counts rather than narrative details to protect all parties, but ensures that a facilitator with a pattern of reports cannot hide that pattern behind the reputation system.\n5.6 Facilitator Removal Process\nThe council identified that v2 had no clear process for removing facilitators who cause harm, especially those who have achieved Distinguished or Elder status with governance power. The removal process operates on three levels.\nFor immediate suspension pending investigation, the Trust and Safety Panel can suspend any facilitator at any tier based on a credible report of serious harm (boundary violations, consent failures, gross negligence). Suspension is immediate and does not require governance approval. The suspended facilitator cannot run events, appear in the marketplace, or exercise governance rights during the investigation. For mandatory retraining, less severe findings result in the facilitator being placed on a retraining track: they must complete additional training, run a specified number of co-facilitated events with an assigned mentor, and receive satisfactory reviews before reinstatement. For permanent removal, the Trust and Safety Panel can permanently remove a facilitator based on findings of serious harm, repeated violations, or failure to complete retraining. Permanent removal strips all platform access, karma, and governance rights. The decision can be appealed once to an Appeals Panel composed of different members than the original panel.\nCritically, tier status does not protect against removal. An Elder-tier facilitator is subject to exactly the same process as an Entry-tier facilitator. Governance power accumulated through karma does not influence the independent Trust and Safety Panel’s decisions.\n\n6. Economic Model and Sustainability Safeguards\nCouncil Response — Financial Sustainability (previously 4/10): \nThe council identified critical risks: PWYW payments decline 15–30% as novelty fades, free-rider problems compound at scale, facilitator income volatility makes professional work unsustainable, real-time surplus dashboards create strategic late-payer behavior, and post-event cognitive burden is high. This version introduces structural safeguards against each risk.\n\n6.1 The Guided Contribution Model\nThe v2 terminology of \"pay-what-feels-right\" is replaced with \"guided contribution\" to set clearer expectations. This is not pure pay-what-you-want; it is a structured sliding scale with an anchor price, a transparent cost floor, and defined options. Research shows that PWYW with reference prices performs significantly better than open-ended PWYW, and that providing a charitable component nearly doubles average payment.\nPre-event, participants see three things: the cost floor (the minimum required to cover actual event costs, calculated as total costs divided by expected participants), the suggested contribution (the cost floor plus the facilitator’s stated rate plus the platform fee, set as the default), and the solidarity contribution (a higher amount that subsidizes access for others and supports the community fund). The default presented to participants is the suggested contribution, not the minimum. Behavioral research shows that defaults drive the majority of choices.\n6.2 Safeguards Against PWYW Decay\nThe council correctly identified that voluntary payments decline over time as norms shift downward. The following structural mechanisms counteract this decay.\nChapman & Co. Insight — Shared Sacrifice: \nWhen the Great Recession caused Barry-Wehmiller’s revenue to plunge, Chapman asked every employee to take four weeks of unpaid leave rather than laying anyone off. His reasoning: ‘What would a caring family do in a crisis? A family doesn’t lay off one of the kids.’ The response was transformative—employees who could afford it volunteered to take extra time off so financially stretched colleagues wouldn’t have to. BW emerged with higher morale than before the crisis and set an earnings record the following year. This is the exact dynamic the Foundation’s economic model seeks to cultivate: when costs exceed collections, the community collectively bridges the gap rather than any one person absorbing the loss. The solidarity contribution tier, the community fund, and the facilitator minimum guarantee are all structural encodings of Chapman’s family principle.\n\nCost floor guarantee: The platform enforces a minimum payment equal to the cost floor (actual costs divided by participants). This is not optional; it is the price of entry. The sliding scale operates above the cost floor, not from zero. This eliminates the free-rider problem at the structural level while preserving generosity at the top.\nFacilitator minimum guarantee: Facilitators can set a minimum guaranteed rate per event. If total contributions do not cover this minimum after cost allocation, the city community fund bridges the gap up to a defined limit. This reduces income volatility to sustainable levels and means a facilitator’s compensation has a floor, even if turnout is low. The guarantee is capped at 80% of the facilitator’s usual rate to maintain some market signal.\nQuarterly impact storytelling: Following Enspiral’s practice, the platform publishes quarterly impact stories showing exactly what community funds enabled: a participant who attended via scholarship, a venue improvement, a facilitator who traveled cross-city. Research shows that visible impact sustains voluntary contributions over time far better than abstract dashboards.\nNo real-time surplus dashboard: The v2 design included a live dashboard showing collection progress during the 24-hour settlement window. The council identified this as creating strategic late-payer behavior. It is removed. Participants receive a single post-event summary with costs and their contribution options. They make one choice. There is no visible live counter encouraging gaming.\nSimplified post-event settlement: The council flagged cognitive burden as a serious concern. The revised post-event flow presents participants with three clear options (suggested, cost-floor, solidarity) plus a custom field, rather than requiring them to review detailed expense documentation. Full expense documentation remains available for those who want it, but the default experience is a 30-second decision, not a 10-minute audit.\n6.3 Per-Event Revenue Flow\nThe revenue distribution remains transparent and predetermined.\nRevenue Layer\nAllocation\nRationale\nFacilitator compensation\n65% of net revenue above costs\nCreators capture the majority of value\nVenue and production costs\nPass-through at actual cost\nVerified by uploaded invoices/receipts\nPlatform fee\n15% of net revenue\nSplit into transparent sub-buckets below\nSurplus (if any)\nPredefined redistribution\nDetailed in Section 6.4\n\n\n6.4 Surplus Redistribution\nWhen an event collects more than its costs plus facilitator compensation plus platform fee, the surplus follows predefined rules. Forty percent enters the city community fund for local initiatives, accessibility subsidies, and facilitator minimum guarantees. Twenty-five percent goes to the facilitator as a quality bonus. Twenty percent enters the global commons fund for platform development and cross-city support. Fifteen percent enters the reserve fund as an indivisible buffer.\nThe facilitator surplus bonus is reduced from 30% (v2) to 25% to address the council’s concern about perverse incentives to underestimate costs. Additionally, the platform cross-references facilitator cost estimates against actual costs post-event. Facilitators whose estimates consistently diverge significantly from actuals receive a transparency flag visible to participants and ambassadors.\n6.5 Facilitator Exit Risk Mitigation\nThe council identified that facilitators can build reputation on-platform then move high-value relationships off-platform. This is partially by design: the platform does not seek lock-in through artificial switching costs, which would contradict Teal self-management principles. Instead, the platform makes staying more valuable than leaving. A facilitator on-platform has access to cross-city discovery (visible to communities they have never visited), transparent reputation that transfers instantly, community fund guarantees that reduce income volatility, crowdfunded event opportunities, and reduced operational overhead through the financial infrastructure. The platform also allows facilitators to run both on-platform and off-platform events, reducing the binary leave-or-stay pressure.\n\n7. Conflict Resolution and Dispute Process\nDrawing from both the Reinventing Organizations framework and Chapman & Co.’s Truly Human Leadership methodology, conflict is seen as a natural and healthy part of community life. The platform establishes a structured, multi-step conflict resolution process that every community member learns during onboarding. This process applies to interpersonal conflicts between community members, not safety incidents (which follow the Trust and Safety Protocol in Section 5).\nChapman identifies two questions as the most powerful leadership tools available: ‘How does that affect your life?’ and ‘What did that feel like?’ These questions are structurally embedded in the conflict resolution process. Rather than beginning with accusation, justification, or problem-solving, every step of the process begins by inviting each party to describe their experience—what happened and how it felt. Chapman’s research shows that when people feel genuinely heard, the majority of conflicts resolve without escalation. This is not a soft approach; it is a rigorously tested methodology that has worked across 150+ organizational cultures and 12,000 employees at Barry-Wehmiller.\n7.1 The Three-Step Conflict Resolution Process\nStep 1 — Direct Conversation: Two parties in conflict first attempt to resolve it one-on-one, speaking from personal experience using \"I\" statements rather than accusations. The platform provides conversation guides and optional facilitation prompts. No third parties are involved at this stage.\nStep 2 — Peer Mediation: If direct conversation does not resolve the conflict, either party can invite a mutually agreed-upon community member to serve as mediator. The mediator does not impose a solution; they help both parties hear each other and find a resolution that works. The platform maintains a list of community members who have completed mediation training and are willing to serve.\nStep 3 — Community Panel: If peer mediation fails, a panel of three community members (one chosen by each party, one chosen by the community ambassador) hears both sides and makes a non-binding recommendation. If the recommendation is not accepted, the matter can be escalated to the city-level governance process. In rare cases involving potential harm, the Trust and Safety Panel (Section 5.3) takes jurisdiction.\n7.2 Restorative Over Punitive\nFollowing Teal principles, the conflict resolution process prioritizes restoration over punishment. The goal is not to determine who is right and who is wrong, but to repair relationships and prevent recurrence. When a facilitator receives negative feedback, the first response is a supported conversation between the facilitator and affected participants, not a public rating decrease. Only when restorative approaches have been exhausted do punitive measures (tier demotion, suspension) come into play. This is consistent with the Reinventing Organizations insight that in self-managing organizations, accountability comes from peer relationships, not from authority figures imposing consequences.\n\n8. Governance: Radically Simplified for Beta\nCouncil Response — Governance (previously 5/10): \nThe council identified multiple attack surfaces in the v2 governance system: low Voice activation barrier creating sybil risk, facilitator cartel potential, ambassador accountability gaps, karma gaming via multi-category maxing, off-platform vote buying in tight-knit communities, and governance complexity that burdens casual participants. This version radically simplifies governance for the beta phase and defers complex mechanisms until community-driven demand for them is demonstrated.\n\n8.1 Beta Governance: Year 1\nDuring the beta phase (first 12–18 months), the governance system is intentionally simple. The Advice Process from Reinventing Organizations replaces voting for most decisions: anyone can propose anything, as long as they first seek advice from those affected and those with expertise. The proposal is then executed unless someone raises a principled objection (not a preference, but a reasoned concern about harm to the community). This is consent-based decision-making from sociocracy: “good enough for now, safe enough to try.”\nThe dual-token system (karma and voice) is not implemented during beta. Instead, the platform uses a simple membership model: active members (those who have attended 5 or more events in the past 6 months and contributed in at least one non-financial way, such as volunteering, providing feedback, or co-facilitating) are eligible to participate in governance decisions. This higher threshold of 5 events (raised from 3 in v2) and the 6-month active window address the council’s sybil attack concern.\nGovernance decisions during beta are made through consent-based proposals on a simple discussion platform (such as Loomio), not through token-weighted voting. One member, one voice. No quadratic voting, no conviction voting, no token mechanics. These mechanisms are documented in the design appendix as future options to be activated only when the community reaches sufficient scale (200 or more active members in a city) and demonstrates demand for more sophisticated governance.\nChapman & Co.’s blog research on team dynamics identifies five patterns that keep even high-performing teams stuck: mistaking activity for alignment, underestimating connection needs, leaving decision-making processes unspoken, avoiding honest conversations, and failing to revisit team norms as context changes. Each of these patterns is addressed by the beta governance design. Consent-based governance makes decision-making processes explicit, not assumed. The Advice Process requires connecting with affected parties before acting, addressing both alignment and connection. The quarterly in-person community gathering (Experiment 4 in Section 11) creates space for the honest conversations that digital tools alone cannot facilitate. And the scheduled review dates on all Layer 3 agreements ensure that team norms are revisited regularly. Chapman’s core insight here is that the breakthrough for a community is not fixing what is broken but bringing intention to culture, communication, and collaboration—which is exactly what the Advice Process does.\n8.2 Ambassador Accountability\nThe council identified that community ambassadors have gatekeeping power (facilitator verification) without defined accountability to the community they serve. The following accountability mechanisms apply during beta and beyond.\nAmbassador selection is transparent: candidates are nominated by the founding team or existing community and confirmed by community consent (no objections from active members within a 14-day deliberation period). Ambassadors serve fixed 12-month terms, renewable once through the same consent process. Maximum two consecutive terms prevents entrenchment. Ambassador decisions on facilitator verification are documented and visible to all active members, with rationale provided for any rejection. Any active member can raise a challenge to an ambassador decision through the Advice Process. Ambassadors are subject to the same Trust and Safety Protocol as facilitators: reports can be filed against ambassadors, and the Trust and Safety Panel can remove an ambassador for cause. Ambassador performance is reviewed at the end of each term through a community feedback survey with results shared openly.\n8.3 Anti-Cartel Protections\nThe council raised the risk of facilitator cartels: 3–5 established facilitators coordinating to dominate governance and exclude newcomers. The following structural protections apply.\nFacilitators and participants have distinct governance roles. In consent-based decisions affecting facilitator standards, both facilitator and participant perspectives must be represented in the advice-seeking process. No proposal affecting facilitator verification, tier advancement, or marketplace policies can proceed without documented advice from at least three non-facilitator active members. Ambassador verification decisions require sign-off from two ambassadors (not one), preventing individual gatekeeping. In cities with only two ambassadors, verification decisions are visible to all active members with a 7-day objection window. The marketplace is open: any facilitator who meets the safety training requirements and completes the trial event process must be admitted, regardless of whether existing facilitators object. There is no franchise model and no territorial exclusivity.\n8.4 Future Governance Evolution\nThe dual-token system, quadratic voting, conviction voting, and karma mechanics described in v2 are preserved as design options for future implementation, documented in a Governance Design Appendix. They are activated only when the community has at least 200 active members in a city, the community explicitly votes to adopt more sophisticated governance (through the existing consent process), and the mechanisms have been piloted with a subset of willing participants and shown to add value without excluding casual participants. This follows the Reinventing Organizations principle of evolutionary purpose: the governance system evolves based on the community’s lived experience and expressed needs, not based on a predetermined design imposed from the top.\n\n9. Constitutional Framework\nThe platform’s governance documents are organized in four layers with escalating amendment thresholds. This architecture is unchanged from v2 and draws from Burning Man’s 10 Principles, B Corp certification, Enspiral’s agreements framework, and sociocratic consent-based decision-making.\n9.1 Layer 1: Core Values\nFoundational values that define the platform’s identity. These emerge from the organic culture of the conscious gatherings community and are codified only after sufficient events have been run to observe what norms actually emerge (following Burning Man’s approach of codifying what already works). The initial proposed values are: Embodiment, Radical Inclusivity, Consent Culture, Transparent Economics, Community Sovereignty, Ecological Stewardship, Active Participation, and Participant Safety. Amendment requires 80% or higher supermajority with a 6-month deliberation period and 50% quorum.\n9.2 Layer 2: Charter and Bylaws\nLegal structure, membership classes, economic model parameters, and the Trust and Safety Protocol’s structural elements. Amendment requires two-thirds supermajority with 30-day notification.\n9.3 Layer 3: Agreements and Policies\nOperational agreements changed through the consent-based Advice Process. Any active member can propose changes. Agreements pass when no principled objections remain after the deliberation period. All agreements carry a review date.\n9.4 Layer 4: Guidelines and Guides\nNon-binding best practices updated by working groups. Cultural norms like no-shoes-on-the-dance-floor evolve organically.\n9.5 Scope Boundary and Evolution\nThe initial scope includes experience-driven active engagement events where participants are physically present and actively involved: movement practices, sonic experiences, breathwork, creative workshops, wellness practices, nature-based experiences, community gatherings with an active component, and family and child-friendly activities. Out of scope: passive consumption events (concerts, lectures, film screenings), traditional profit-maximizing event management, purely virtual events, and events that violate core values.\nScope expansion follows a structured process: values alignment check against Layer 1, 4–6 week community deliberation, 6-month pilot approved by simple majority, and formal permanent inclusion requiring two-thirds supermajority based on pilot data.\n\n10. Skills Marketplace and Community Crowdfunding\nThe marketplace is a discovery layer where facilitators create profiles showcasing their skills, experience, portfolio, safety training, and transparent pricing history. It enables facilitators traveling to new cities to be instantly visible to local communities, communities to browse talent when commissioning events through crowdfunding, and quality comparison through transparent, community-verified information. Chapman & Co.’s blog insight that ‘customer service is not a department, it’s a leadership imperative because every team member impacts the customer experience regardless of role’ applies directly here: participant experience is not solely the facilitator’s responsibility. Every community member—the Safety Holder, the person who brings tea, the regular who welcomes a newcomer—shapes the experience. The marketplace and rating system acknowledge this by allowing participants to recognize not only facilitators but also outstanding community contributors, which feeds into governance eligibility and the culture of recognition described in Section 1.4.\n10.1 Profile Structure (Revised for Safety Transparency)\nEach facilitator profile now includes, alongside the portfolio and rating elements described in v2, a Safety Credentials section showing completed training modules, accreditation body certifications, most recent training date, insurance status, and aggregate safety record (number of events, number of incident reports, outcomes). This directly addresses the council’s finding that v2 emphasized financial transparency but was silent on safety transparency.\n10.2 Community Crowdfunding\nThe crowdfunding mechanism allows communities to collectively propose and fund events, flipping the traditional supply-driven model to demand-driven programming. Any community member proposes an event concept. Members pledge contributions toward a minimum viable budget covering venue, materials, and a guaranteed facilitator base fee. Once funded, the community selects facilitators from the marketplace or opens it to proposals. Multi-provider ensembles are supported. After the event, the standard post-event transparency and guided contribution process applies.\nA specific assumption test for crowdfunding is included in Section 11 (Experiment 6), as the council noted that it should be validated separately from the core event model.\n\n11. Assumptions Testing Framework\nCouncil Response: \nAll five agents emphasized that core assumptions must be tested with manual processes (Google Sheets, WhatsApp) before any technology is built. The council’s recommended first step is to run 10–15 events using manual tools to track payment distributions, free-rider rates, participant cognitive burden, facilitator income stability, governance participation, and safety protocol effectiveness.\n\nAll experiments run during Phase 1 (Zurich, months 1–6) using existing tools. No platform technology is built until experiments are completed and success criteria are evaluated.\n11.1 Experiment 1: Guided Contribution Viability\nAssumption: Participants will pay at or above the suggested contribution when given a transparent cost breakdown and a structured sliding scale with a cost floor.\nDesign: A/B test across 10+ events. Group A pays a fixed price at the suggested contribution amount. Group B uses the guided contribution model with cost floor, suggested, and solidarity tiers plus transparent cost breakdown.\nSuccess Criteria: Average payment in Group B reaches 90%+ of Group A; fewer than 15% pay at the cost floor; 20%+ choose the solidarity tier.\n11.2 Experiment 2: Facilitator Acceptance\nAssumption: Facilitators will accept transparent economics, community feedback, and the minimum guarantee model.\nDesign: Interview 15–20 facilitators. Pilot with 5–8 facilitators for 3 events each with guaranteed minimum plus upside.\nSuccess Criteria: 60%+ express interest; 80%+ complete all pilot events; average compensation reaches 90%+ of their typical rate.\n11.3 Experiment 3: Safety Protocol Effectiveness\nAssumption: The Trust and Safety Protocol can be implemented in practice without being burdensome or reducing the quality of the experience.\nDesign: Implement full safety protocol (informed consent, Safety Holder, post-event feedback on safety experience) at all pilot events. Survey participants on whether the safety measures felt supportive or intrusive. Survey facilitators on whether the requirements are feasible.\nSuccess Criteria: 80%+ of participants report feeling safer because of the protocol; fewer than 10% report it as intrusive or detracting from the experience; 90%+ of facilitators report the requirements as reasonable.\n11.4 Experiment 4: Governance Participation\nAssumption: Community members will engage in consent-based governance decisions.\nDesign: Progressive funnel: post-event feedback (50%+ target), monthly community decision on Loomio or WhatsApp poll (25%+ target), quarterly in-person community gathering (10%+ target). Start with tangible, low-stakes decisions before financial allocation.\nSuccess Criteria: Meet or exceed each funnel target within 6 months.\n11.5 Experiment 5: Platform Discovery Value\nAssumption: The platform provides meaningful discovery value beyond WhatsApp groups.\nDesign: Run 10 events using manual tools. Track discovery channels. Measure whether trust signals (transparent pricing history, safety credentials) influence attendance.\nSuccess Criteria: 20%+ discovery through platform channels by event 5; repeat attendance 40%+; NPS 50+.\n11.6 Experiment 6: Crowdfunding Demand\nAssumption: Communities will proactively propose and crowdfund events.\nDesign: After 10+ standard events, post 3 community proposals via WhatsApp with Google Forms pledge forms. Track pledge rates, funding speed, and resulting event satisfaction.\nSuccess Criteria: At least 2 of 3 proposals reach minimum funding within 7 days; satisfaction equal to or higher than facilitator-initiated events.\n11.7 Experiment 7: Community Culture Health\nAssumption: The community develops a distinctive, measurable culture of care and trust that differentiates it from alternatives.\nDesign: Drawing from Chapman & Co.’s Organizational Culture Survey methodology, administer a brief culture pulse at 3 months and 6 months measuring three dimensions that Chapman identifies as the foundation of healthy organizational culture: People (do community members feel genuinely cared for, heard, and valued?), Purpose (does the community have a clear, shared sense of why it exists beyond individual events?), and Process (are the operational systems—pricing, feedback, governance—experienced as fair and transparent?). Chapman & Co. warns that the five biggest mistakes in culture surveys are treating them as one-off rituals, failing to act on results, surveying without context, ignoring qualitative signals, and not closing the feedback loop. The Foundation avoids each: the pulse is recurring, results are shared openly with the community and drive specific actions, participants understand the survey’s purpose, qualitative questions are included, and every survey cycle concludes with a community conversation about what was learned and what changes.\nSuccess Criteria: 80%+ report feeling valued and heard; 70%+ can articulate the community’s purpose in their own words; 75%+ rate processes as fair; improvement from 3-month to 6-month pulse on at least 2 of 3 dimensions.\n11.8 North Star Metric\nRevenue-weighted repeat attendance: the guided contribution revenue contributed by returning participants. This captures both financial sustainability and community health. Supplemented by facilitator NPS, community fund generation per event, safety protocol satisfaction scores, and governance participation rates.\n\n12. Facilitator Verification and Tiered Advancement\nThe facilitator development model draws directly from Chapman & Co.’s insight that leadership is not management—it cannot be imposed through rules, but must be cultivated through skills, mentorship, and practice. Barry-Wehmiller’s 12 Essential Practices of Leadership, distilled from 500+ behavioral observations of their best frontline leaders, provide the template for what the Foundation expects from facilitators at every tier. Adapted for the gathering context, the core practices include: stewarding the community’s values through personal example (not just policy compliance); advocating safety and wellbeing through actions and words; inspiring passion, optimism, and purpose in every session; cultivating fulfilling relationships through personal communication; fostering a team community committed to each other and a common purpose; exercising responsible freedom that empowers participants; proactively engaging in the personal growth of community members; facilitating meaningful group interactions; and recognizing and celebrating the goodness in others. These are not abstract aspirations—they are observable, teachable behaviors that are assessed during trial events and reviewed during tier advancement.\n12.1 Revised Tier System\nTier\nRequirements\nBenefits\nEntry\nComplete safety training module (Section 5.1), screening conversation with 2 ambassadors, portfolio submission, 1 trial event with co-facilitation from an Established+ facilitator, participant feedback above minimum threshold\nListed in marketplace with Entry badge; access to community events calendar; basic financial tools; Safety Holder training included\nEstablished\n8+ successful events over 4+ months (raised from 5 in v2), consistent positive ratings, full expense transparency compliance, zero unresolved safety incidents, demonstrated contraindications screening competence\nPriority marketplace visibility; access to premium venues; featured in city discovery; eligible for facilitator minimum guarantee\nDistinguished\n15+ events over 8+ months, community nomination from 3+ non-facilitator active members (not just facilitator endorsements), demonstrated community contribution beyond facilitation (mentoring, volunteering, Safety Holder service)\nCross-city visibility; crowdfunded travel commissions; mentoring role; community fund access for event innovation\nElder\nSustained Distinguished-level contribution over 18+ months, recognition by 2+ city nodes, no safety incidents in preceding 12 months, active contribution to platform governance and knowledge sharing\nGovernance advisory role; priority venue partnerships; ambassador eligibility; invited to annual Foundation retreat\n\n\nNotable changes from v2: all thresholds are raised to reduce cartel formation risk. Distinguished advancement requires nomination from non-facilitator community members, preventing facilitator cliques from self-promoting. Safety record is an explicit requirement at every tier transition. Elder tier requires contribution across multiple city nodes, preventing local entrenchment. The 10-participant onboarding requirement from v2 is removed as it created perverse incentives; instead, the trial event co-facilitation requirement ensures quality without forcing artificial community-building.\nChapman & Co. Insight — Culture Scales Through People, Not Documents: \nBarry-Wehmiller has successfully maintained a coherent culture of Truly Human Leadership across 150+ acquisitions in 28 countries. They accomplish this not through policy manuals but through Barry-Wehmiller University, which teaches human skills (listening, recognition, service) to every new team member, and through leaders who personally embody the culture during every acquisition integration. When BW acquires a company, Chapman personally visits to share the Guiding Principles and to listen to the existing team’s culture. They embrace the unique culture of each acquisition while holding the core values constant. This is the Foundation’s multi-city scaling model: core values and safety standards are universal, but city nodes develop their own cultural character. Every new city launch begins with the founders personally sharing the principles and listening to the local community—not distributing a policy document. Co-facilitation with experienced facilitators (mirroring BW’s mentorship model) is how culture actually transfers from one node to the next.\n\n\n13. Technical Foundation and AI Position\n13.1 Open Collective Fork\nThe platform builds on Open Collective’s MIT-licensed codebase, providing transparent financial dashboards, expense management with receipts, and fiscal hosting capabilities. Additional layers built on top include the facilitator verification and rating system, the marketplace and crowdfunding engine, the event management and guided contribution workflow, the safety credentials and incident reporting system, and consent-based governance tools (initially simple polls and proposals, with more sophisticated mechanisms available as modular additions).\n13.2 Data Minimalism\nThe platform stores primarily text, small images, transaction records, ratings, and safety documentation. Content is external: facilitators link to YouTube, Instagram, SoundCloud. Infrastructure costs remain low even at scale. Peer-to-peer or federated node architecture is explored for Phase 3+ to reduce centralization. Karma portability across cities, when the token system is eventually implemented, uses a single global reputation score with city-specific context (how many events in each city), addressing the council’s concern about gaming through city-hopping.\n13.3 AI Position\nAI is not a marketed feature. It may be used as invisible infrastructure for expense receipt scanning, automated safety checklist verification when events are created, and pattern detection in incident reports (surfacing facilitators with emerging patterns before they become crises). AI is never used for recommendation algorithms, content curation, or any system that replaces community-driven discovery with algorithmic optimization. The platform’s intelligence comes from its community, not its algorithms.\n\n14. Organizational Sustainability\nThe Foundation is structured as a non-profit. There are no shares and no shareholders. Founders and staff are compensated with fair salaries for value created. The organization is designed to be governed by its communities within 3 years. This structure draws inspiration from two Chapman initiatives: the Chapman Foundation for Caring Communities (a nonprofit that delivers Listen Like a Leader training to hospitals, police departments, schools, and community organizations at no charge) and the Chapman & Co. Leadership Institute (a consultancy that sustains itself through the value it delivers to organizations). Together, these models demonstrate that a mission-driven organization can provide free or low-cost community services while generating sufficient revenue from premium services to sustain operations.\nRevenue comes from the platform fee on event transactions (15% of net revenue above costs). For free events, no fee is charged. Additional revenue: premium venue partnership commissions, optional tools for high-volume facilitators, and aligned grants or donations. Quarterly financial reports are published with full narrative context.\nThe founding team governs during Year 1, transitions governance in Year 2 (city nodes gain autonomy, facilitator and participant representatives join the board, community voting activates), and by Year 3 the Foundation is governed by its communities through the constitutional framework. This transition is a commitment, not an aspiration, documented in the Charter as a binding timeline.\n14.1 Purpose and Values Discovery\nChapman & Co.’s consulting work begins every organizational engagement with Purpose and Values Discovery: translating existing core values into leadership principles that guide daily behavior. At Barry-Wehmiller, this process produced the Guiding Principles of Leadership, a cultural vision statement that has been the cornerstone of the company for over two decades and has been studied by Harvard Business School and taught at 70+ institutions globally. The Foundation applies this approach to each city node launch: before any events are organized, the founding group in each city goes through a facilitated values discovery process to articulate how the Foundation’s universal principles (Section 9, Layer 1) will be expressed in local language and cultural context. This is not a top-down branding exercise but a generative process where local founding members articulate in their own words what these values mean to them and how they want to live them. The resulting city-level values statement becomes the Cultural Adaptation Playbook’s backbone for that node. Chapman’s experience shows that when people have participated in articulating values, they hold themselves and each other accountable to them without external enforcement—exactly the self-managing dynamic the Foundation depends on.\n\n15. Revised Timeline\nPhase\nTimeline\nCity\nKey Activities\nPhase 1: Deep Validation\nMonths 1–6\nZurich\nDevelop Trust & Safety Protocol with external expert review.
