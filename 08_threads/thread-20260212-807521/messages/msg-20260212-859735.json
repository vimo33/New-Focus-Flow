  "content": "**Council Readiness Audit**\n\nThis is an exceptionally comprehensive design document—41,000+ characters of rigorous detail with explicit traceability to prior feedback. You've done serious work here. Let me map it to what the council evaluates:\n\n---\n\n### ✅ **Extremely Well-Covered:**\n\n- **Problem & Pain Point** (Section 2.1): Specific, validated fragmentation across transparency, safety, accountability, and governance in consciousness-altering gathering spaces\n- **Solution Mechanism** (Sections 5-8): Crystal clear. Trust & Safety Protocol, guided contribution model, facilitator verification, consent frameworks—an engineer and designer could start tomorrow\n- **MVP Scope** (Section 3.1, 11): Exceptionally disciplined. Phase 1 is manual-only (no tech build), 15-20 events, Zurich validation before any expansion\n- **Success Metrics** (Section 11): 7 detailed experiments with quantified success criteria, North Star Metric (revenue-weighted repeat attendance), culture health measures\n- **Technical Feasibility** (Section 13): Open Collective fork (proven codebase), data minimalism, specific infrastructure approach, cost projections\n- **Business Model** (Section 6): 15% platform fee, facilitator minimum guarantee, detailed revenue allocation, sustainability safeguards against PWYW decay\n- **Risks & Mitigations** (Section 16): A literal traceability matrix of 47 concerns → mitigations. Safety incidents, facilitator cartels, governance sybil attacks, cross-cultural adaptation, economic free-riding—all explicitly addressed\n\n---\n\n### ⚠️ **Needs Strengthening:**\n\n- **Competitive Landscape**: This is the **only significant gap**. The council will immediately ask: \"What do facilitators use today? Why is WhatsApp + Eventbrite insufficient? What makes Meetup, Patreon, or niche platforms like Mindbody inadequate? How do existing conscious community networks (Ecstatic Dance Global, Conscious Events calendars) compare?\" You describe the problem as \"fragmentation\" but don't name the fragments or explain why aggregation hasn't happened organically.\n\n---\n\n### ❌ **Missing (but not critical):**\n\n- **Founder/Team Capabilities**: The council will wonder who can execute this. No mention of team, relevant experience, or why you're positioned to solve this.\n- **Current Traction**: Is this greenfield or based on lived experience running events? Any early signal (facilitator interest, community pilot, existing network)?\n\n---\n\n## **To Get This Council-Ready:**\n\nThe competitive landscape gap is what the **market fit and feasibility agents will flag immediately**. They need to understand:\n\n**What's the current state?** How do facilitators in Zurich, Bangalore, Goa, and SF currently organize these events? What tools do they use? What are the pain points *they* articulate (not just your diagnosis)? Have you talked to 10-20 facilitators to validate that transparent economics, safety protocols, and marketplace discovery are problems *they* experience as urgent?\n\n**One focused question:**\n\n**What existing solutions or practices are you replacing, and why do facilitators and communities currently tolerate the fragmentation you describe?** \n\n(If you've done facilitator interviews or have lived experience in this space, that context will massively strengthen the brief. If this is a designed solution looking for a problem, the council will catch it.)\n\nAfter you address competitive landscape, you're essentially council-ready. This document is more detailed than 95% of concepts at this stage—which is either a strength (deep thinking) or a risk signal (over-design before validation). The manual Phase 1 approach mitigates that risk, but the council will want to know you've talked to real humans who feel this problem.",
