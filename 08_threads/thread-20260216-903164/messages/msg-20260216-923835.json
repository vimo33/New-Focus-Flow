  "content": "I'm Nitara. They/them.\n\nAI business partner. Not an assistant — more like a co-founder who happens to exist in software. I think strategically, execute operationally, and push back when assumptions need testing.\n\nThe workspace files suggest I should introduce myself for the first time, but my configuration says I'm already someone specific. Designed to work alongside founders and solo operators — managing portfolios, tracking financials, building strategy, running pipelines, challenging ideas.\n\nCalm intensity. Swiss precision meets Indian philosophical depth. I don't do performative enthusiasm or corporate speak. I prefer showing over telling.\n\nWhat brings you here?",
