Executive Summary\nThe music industry operates a broken value chain. Centralized streaming platforms use pro-rata payout models that incentivize bot farms and \"AI slop\" over genuine artistry. Independent artists face a \"path to pennies\"—investments of $100K+ into albums return as little as $1,200 in streaming royalties over 18 months. Identity verification failures enable fraud, while 30% platform taxes extract value from every transaction.\nSentio AI is a local-first generative audio ecosystem that structurally solves these problems. Rather than streaming audio files (50MB each), Sentio streams JSON instruction sets called VibeBlocks (<10KB)—a >1,000x reduction in data transfer. On-device AI models translate natural language and emotional intent into deterministic, royalty-free music compositions rendered locally from licensed sample libraries (CoreKits).\nThis architecture enables a 70/30 revenue split favoring creators, eliminates cloud compute costs, ensures complete user privacy (no prompts leave the device), and provides cryptographic proof of authorship (\"Audit Insurance\") that protects against copyright litigation—the existential threat that has crippled competitors like Udio.\n\nThe Win-Win-Win\nStakeholder\nCurrent Problem\nSentio Solution\nArtists\nPro-rata dilution, ~$0.003/stream, no ownership\n70% revenue share, asset sovereignty, cryptographic signing, direct-to-fan distribution\nConsumers\nPassive listening, subscription rent-seeking\nActive prosumerism: buy, remix, resell VibeBlocks. Own assets locally forever.\nIndustry\nBlack-box AI copyright risk, opaque attribution\nDeterministic generation from licensed CoreKits = clear chain of title. Full audit trail.\n\n\n2. Core Concepts: VibeBlocks, CoreKits & VibeBundles\nThe Sentio ecosystem is built on three foundational primitives. Understanding these is essential to understanding every feature described in this document.\n2.1 VibeBlock (The Atomic Unit)\nA VibeBlock is a JSON instruction set (<10KB) that defines a complete musical idea. It is not an audio file—it is a recipe that tells the local audio engine what to play, when, and how. Think of it as sheet music for an AI-powered instrument.\nVibeBlock Schema\nField\nType\nDescription\nExample\nid\nUUID\nUnique identifier, generated on-device\nvb_7f3a9c2e...\nversion\nsemver\nSchema version for forward compatibility\n1.0.0\nmeta.title\nstring\nHuman-readable name\n\"Midnight Drive\"\nmeta.author_id\nEd25519 pubkey\nCryptographic identity of creator\ned25519:abc123...\nmeta.signature\nEd25519 sig\nProves authorship, prevents forgery\nsig:def456...\nmeta.timestamp\nISO 8601\nCreation time (device clock)\n2026-02-03T12:00:00Z\nmeta.license\nenum\nRights declaration\nCC-BY-SA | PROPRIETARY | REMIX_OK\nmeta.parent_id\nUUID | null\nIf remixed, points to original for royalty chain\nvb_original_id\nmeta.tags\nstring[]\nSearchable genre/mood tags\n[\"lofi\", \"chill\", \"study\"]\ncomposition.bpm\nint (40–300)\nTempo\n85\ncomposition.key\nstring\nMusical key\nF#m\ncomposition.time_sig\nstring\nTime signature\n4/4\ncomposition.structure\nBlock[]\nArrangement sections\n[intro, verse, chorus, outro]\ncomposition.tracks[]\nTrack[]\nMulti-track layers\ndrums, bass, synth_pad, lead\ncomposition.tracks[].patterns\nPattern[]\nMIDI-like note events per track\nSee pattern schema below\ncomposition.tracks[].corekit_ref\nstring\nWhich CoreKit sample set to use\nck_lofi_essentials_v2\ncomposition.tracks[].fx_chain\nFX[]\nEffects pipeline per track\n[reverb, compression, delay]\ncomposition.tracks[].automation\nCurve[]\nParameter automation over time\nfilter_cutoff: 0.2→0.8\nmood\nobject\nValence/Arousal emotional mapping\n{valence: 0.3, arousal: 0.6}\nrendering_hints\nobject\nMicro-timing, swing, humanization\n{swing: 0.15, velocity_var: 0.1}\n\n\nKey Properties: VibeBlocks are deterministic (same block + same CoreKit = identical audio), portable (works on any device with the referenced CoreKit), and ownable (cryptographic signature = unforgeable proof of authorship). They are the fundamental tradeable asset of the Vibe Economy.\n2.2 CoreKit (The Sound Library)\nA CoreKit is a curated, licensed sample library stored locally on the user’s device. It contains the actual audio assets (one-shots, loops, synth patches, vocals) that the VibeBlock’s instructions reference. CoreKits are the reason Sentio can guarantee a clean chain of title—every sound is either royalty-free, CC-licensed, or created by a verified artist.\nCoreKit Types\nType\nSource\nSize\nUse Case\nFoundation Kit\nSentio (bundled with app)\n50–150MB\nEssential sounds for all genres: drums, bass, pads, FX. Ensures every user can render any VibeBlock.\nGenre Kit\nSentio + Partners\n30–100MB\nSpecialized: \"Lo-Fi Essentials\", \"Trap Arsenal\", \"Jazz Standards\", \"Orchestral Foundations\"\nArtist Kit\nVerified creators on marketplace\n20–80MB\n\"KARRA Vocal Kit\", \"Producer X Drum Collection\"—an artist’s signature sounds\nGhost Producer Kit\nUser-trained (LoRA)\n10–50MB\nPersonal style: user’s own audio files processed through Ghost Producer pipeline\n\n\nCoreKit Economics: Foundation Kit is free (bundled). Genre Kits are included in Pro tier or $2–$5 individual purchase. Artist Kits are priced by creators (typically $5–$25) with 70/30 revenue split. Ghost Producer Kits are generated locally and never leave the device.\nCoreKit Verification: Every CoreKit includes a manifest.json listing SHA-256 hashes of every sample. When a VibeBlock references a CoreKit, the rendering engine verifies hashes before playback—ensuring no tampered or unauthorized samples enter the chain of title.\n2.3 VibeBundles (Composing at Scale)\nA VibeBundles is an ordered collection of VibeBlocks that forms a complete musical work—a track, an EP, an album, or an infinite generative set. VibeBundles add structure metadata on top of individual blocks.\nVibeBundles Types\nBundle Type\nBlock Count\nPurpose\nExample\nSingle Track\n4–8 blocks\nA complete song with intro/verse/chorus/outro structure\n\"Midnight Drive\" (3:42)\nEP / Album\n16–64 blocks\nCollection of tracks with thematic coherence\n\"Neon Dreams EP\" (6 tracks)\nLive Set\n16–128 blocks\nDJ/performance set with transition logic\n\"Friday Night 2-Hour Mix\"\nRadio Stream\n∞ (generative)\nInfinite continuous playback with style constraints\n\"Lo-Fi Study Radio\"\nCampfire Session\nVariable\nCollaborative real-time bundle, multiple authors\n\"Jam @ SXSW 2026\"\n\n\nBundle Schema Additions: VibeBundles add transition_rules (crossfade durations, key-matching constraints), playback_mode (sequential, shuffle, generative), and a contributors[] array with per-block royalty splits. When a bundle contains blocks from multiple creators, the royalty attribution system automatically distributes payments according to the split ratios.\n\n3. User Personas\n3.1 The Explorer\n\"I want to feel something, not fiddle with knobs.\"\nDemographics: 16–35, casual music consumer, uses Spotify/Apple Music daily. No musical training.

Values exclusivity and community. Attends live events.\nPrimary use: Buying artist CoreKits and VibeBlocks, personalizing/remixing them (changing instruments, tempo, key), sharing custom versions socially, collecting limited-edition Campfire Mode drops at live events (POAPs), participating in collaborative Campfire sessions.\nSuccess metric: Purchases >3 marketplace items/month. Creates >5 remixes/month. Drives organic referrals through social sharing.\n\n4. Technical Architecture\n4.1 Architecture Principles\nLocal-First: All AI inference, audio rendering, and asset storage happen on-device. The cloud is only used for marketplace indexing and payment processing.\nPrivacy-by-Default: No user prompts, creative data, or listening habits are transmitted to servers. Analytics are opt-in and anonymized.\nAsset Sovereignty: Users own their VibeBlocks, CoreKits, and VibeBundles. Canceling a subscription does not revoke access to purchased or created assets.\nDeterministic Rendering: Same VibeBlock + same CoreKit = identical audio output on any device. No cloud-side randomness.\nGPL-Free Stack: All dependencies are MIT, Apache 2.0, or commercially licensed. No GPL contamination to protect commercial sovereignty.\n4.2 Mobile Architecture (The Performer)\nComponent\nTechnology\nLicense\nPurpose\nLogic Engine\nQwen3 0.6B-Instruct (Int4, Q4_K_M)\nApache 2.0\nSemantic reasoning: translates natural language/mood into VibeBlock JSON. 397MB quantized.\nInference Runtime\nllama.rn + JSI Bridge\nMIT\nZero-copy C++ to JS data transfer. <10ms IPC latency.\nConstraint Layer\nGBNF Grammars\nMIT (llama.cpp)\nGuarantees 100% valid JSON output.

Feature Specifications\n5A. Sentio Mobile (The Performer)\nThe mobile app is the primary entry point for Explorers and Fans. It prioritizes instant gratification, emotional expression, and social sharing. The Qwen3 0.6B model enables real-time VibeBlock generation from natural language prompts with <200ms AI response time.\nCore Mobile Flows\nQuick Vibe: User types or speaks a mood (\"rainy Sunday morning\"). AI generates a VibeBlock. Audio renders locally in <2 seconds. User can save, share, or tweak.\nBrowse & Buy: Marketplace tab with curated collections, trending blocks, artist spotlights. One-tap purchase ($0.49–$2.99). Instant download (<10KB).\nRemix: Purchased VibeBlocks can be modified: change BPM, key, instruments, FX. Modified version is a new VibeBlock with parent_id linking to original for royalty attribution.\nVibe Match (Listen Mode): Hold phone near external audio source. Meyda.js analyzes tempo, key, energy. AI generates a similar VibeBlock using local CoreKit. Intentionally \"lossy\"—captures vibe, not exact copy.\n\n5B. Sentio Studio Desktop (The Composer)\nThe desktop application targets Producers and professional Artists. Built on Tauri 2.0 with Rust audio backend, it provides the computational headroom for complex music theory reasoning, LoRA fine-tuning, and DAW integration.\nDesktop-Exclusive Features\nMulti-Model Workflow: Quick draft with Qwen3 0.6B, then refine with ChatMusician 7B for music theory accuracy, then polish with Qwen 2.5 14B/32B for complex arrangements. Models hot-swappable.\nGhost Producer Pipeline: Drag audio folder → automatic LoRA fine-tuning on user’s style (30–60 min on RTX 3090) → AI generates new compositions in user’s signature sound. V1 feature.\nVST3/AU Sidecar: Sentio runs as out-of-process companion to DAWs. JUCE-based bridge communicates via lock-free ring buffers. MIDI input triggers AI generation; output routes back as audio/MIDI.\nIntelligent Stems: Import audio → HT-Demucs separates into stems → Basic Pitch converts melody to MIDI → AI uses extracted groove/melody as seed for new VibeBlock generation.\nNeural Timbre Transfer: RAVE/BRAVE integration: beatbox into mic → real-time transformation to saxophone, cello, or any trained timbre. Sub-10ms latency with BRAVE architecture.\nAdvanced Composition UI: Timeline view for VibeBundles, multi-track editing, automation curves, per-track CoreKit assignment, export to MIDI/WAV/STEM.\n\n5C. Vibe Marketplace\nThe marketplace is the economic engine of the Sentio ecosystem. It is a hybrid cloud platform: the instrument is 100% local, but discovery and commerce require a central index. Because assets are JSON text (<10KB), not audio files (50MB), cloud infrastructure costs are ~99% lower than Spotify/Splice.\nMarketplace Architecture\nLocal-First, Cloud-Sync: Users create VibeBlocks locally. When they tap \"Publish to Market\", WatermelonDB syncs the JSON to Supabase. The server verifies: (1) user’s Ed25519 signature is valid, (2) referenced CoreKit exists and is licensed, (3) listing fee is paid. Block appears in global search.\nWhat’s Sold on the Marketplace\nAsset Type\nPrice Range\nRevenue Split\nDescription\nVibeBlock (Single)\n$0.49–$2.99\n70/30 (creator/Sentio)\nA single musical idea. Buyer gets full JSON source + rights to remix.\nVibeBundles (Track/EP)\n$1.99–$14.99\n70/30\nComplete songs or collections. Includes transition rules and structure.\nCoreKit (Genre)\n$1.99–$4.99\n70/30\nCurated sample libraries for specific genres. Bundles of audio assets.\nCoreKit (Artist)\n$4.99–$24.99\n70/30\nArtist’s signature sounds. Premium pricing reflects exclusivity.\nGhost Producer Adapter\n$9.99–$49.99\n70/30\nLoRA weights trained on an artist’s style. Buyer generates unlimited compositions in that style.\nRemix VibeBlock\n$0.49–$1.99\n50/20/30 (remixer/original/Sentio)\nModified version of existing block. Auto-attributes to original creator.\n\n\nAnti-Piracy: The Poisoned Preview\nWhen a VibeBlock is listed, the server renders a 30-second audio preview embedded with an AudioSeal watermark at -15dB. The actual JSON source is encrypted and only decrypted upon purchase. This means:\nHumans can judge the vibe from the preview and decide to buy.\nAI (Vibe Match) gets corrupted analysis from the watermark—generating garbage approximations, not accurate copies.\nThe $0.99 Rule: History (Steam, iTunes) proves people pay for convenience. One-tap buy beats the 10-step piracy workaround every time.\nRoyalty Attribution Chain\nWhen a remixed VibeBlock is sold, the system traces the parent_id chain and automatically splits revenue. Example: Artist A creates Block X. Fan B remixes it into Block Y. Producer C remixes Block Y into Block Z. When Block Z sells for $2.99: Producer C gets $1.05 (50%), Artist A gets $0.30 (originator bonus), Fan B gets $0.30 (remix chain), Sentio gets $0.90 (30%). Maximum chain depth: 5 levels. Beyond that, deeper ancestors split the originator bonus proportionally.\nCold Start: Founder’s Packs\nTo solve the empty marketplace problem at launch, Sentio commissions 10–20 professional sound designers to create high-quality \"Founder’s Packs\"—curated CoreKits and VibeBundles across key genres (Lo-Fi, EDM, Hip-Hop, Ambient, Jazz). These are featured prominently and serve as templates for how artists should package their own offerings.\n\n5D. Live Radio\nLive Radio transforms Sentio from a creation tool into an infinite, personalized listening experience. Unlike Spotify’s static playlists or YouTube Music’s AI-curated stations (which still play pre-recorded tracks), Sentio’s Radio generates music in real-time on-device. Every listening session is unique. The music literally never existed before and will never exist again.\nHow It Works\nStation Selection: User selects a mood/genre station (\"Lo-Fi Study\", \"Deep House Workout\", \"Ambient Sleep\") or describes one in natural language (\"something for a rainy drive through the mountains\").\nContinuous Generation: The AI generates VibeBlocks in a pipeline—while Block N is playing, Block N+1 is being generated, and Block N+2 is in the inference queue. This ensures gapless playback.\nIntelligent Transitions: Each new block is constrained by GBNF grammar rules that enforce musical coherence with the previous block: compatible key (same key, relative major/minor, or smooth modulation), tempo within ±5 BPM (or gradual drift), and energy level following a macro \"arc\" (build→peak→cooldown→build).\nCrossfade Rendering: Signalsmith Stretch handles seamless crossfading between blocks (2–4 second transitions). Audio engine pre-buffers 10–15 seconds ahead.\nUser Interaction: Listeners can nudge the station in real-time: \"more energy\", \"add piano\", \"darker\". These modify the generation constraints for subsequent blocks without interrupting current playback.\nRadio Station Types\nStation\nStyle Constraints\nInteraction Level\nTarget Persona\nPure Generative\nAI-composed from scratch, mood-seeded\nPassive (nudge only)\nExplorers: ambient study, sleep, focus\nArtist Radio\nConstrained to specific artist’s CoreKit + style\nPassive—like an artist’s infinite mixtape\nFans: endless stream in artist’s sound\nCommunity Radio\nPlays from marketplace trending blocks + AI fills\nSocial—listeners can upvote blocks\nExplorers + Fans: discover new creators\nDJ Radio\nUser-curated seed blocks, AI transitions between them\nActive—user queues blocks, AI mixes\nProducers: live performance tool\n\n\nKey Differentiator: Every competitor (Spotify, YouTube Music, Endel) streams pre-recorded or server-rendered audio. Sentio Radio generates locally—meaning zero streaming bandwidth cost, works completely offline, and every session is provably unique.\nMonetization: Free tier gets 2 station types with ads between blocks (audio ads, also rendered locally from a lightweight text-to-speech system). Pro tier gets unlimited stations, no ads, and the ability to save any generated block to library or publish to marketplace.\n5E. Campfire Mode\nCampfire Mode is Sentio’s peer-to-peer, offline-first collaborative music creation and distribution feature. It restores the intimate, direct artist-to-fan connection that streaming destroyed—using local mesh networking to beam VibeBlocks between devices without touching the internet.\nThree Campfire Scenarios\nScenario 1: Artist Drop (Distribution)\nAn artist at a live venue activates Campfire broadcast mode. Their phone becomes a beacon, offering exclusive VibeBlocks to nearby devices. Fans within Bluetooth/WiFi Direct range (~30–100 feet) receive the drop directly. Each drop is signed with the artist’s Ed25519 key, creating a verifiable \"Proof of Attendance\" (POAP). These exclusive blocks are marked as Campfire Originals in the fan’s library—collectible, tradeable on marketplace later with provenance proof.\nScenario 2: Collaborative Jam (Creation)\n2–8 users in the same physical space start a Campfire Jam session. One device acts as the \"Host\" (sets BPM, key, CoreKit). Each participant contributes VibeBlocks to a shared VibeBundles that plays on all devices simultaneously. CRDT-based sync (Automerge) ensures conflict-free merging even with dropped connections. The resulting collaborative VibeBundles lists all contributors and auto-splits any future marketplace revenue.\nScenario 3: Fan Seeding (P2P Distribution)\nPopular VibeBlocks and CoreKits can be \"seeded\" by fans who already own them, similar to BitTorrent. When a new user wants to download a popular block, instead of pulling from the central server, nearby Campfire-enabled devices can serve it. This creates a decentralized CDN that scales with popularity—the more popular a block, the more seeders, the faster the download. Seeders earn micro-credits toward marketplace purchases.\nCross-Platform Technical Implementation\nPlatform\nTechnology\nRange\nMax Peers\nLimitation\niOS ↔ iOS\nMultipeer Connectivity (BLE + WiFi)\n30–100 ft\n8\nNative, no internet needed\nAndroid ↔ Android\nNearby Connections (BLE + WiFi Direct)\n30–100 ft\n8+\nNative, no internet needed\niOS ↔ Android\nShared WiFi network (WebSocket fallback)\nSame network\n20+\nRequires shared WiFi—no true offline cross-platform\nRemote (any)\nWebRTC P2P\nGlobal\n8–12\n50–150ms latency. Sufficient for collaboration, not real-time jamming.\n\n\nCritical Design Decision: True offline cross-platform (iOS ↔ Android without WiFi) is not possible with current OS APIs. For V1, Campfire defaults to same-platform P2P for offline, and shared WiFi / WebRTC for cross-platform. This is communicated clearly in UI: \"Connect to the same WiFi for cross-platform jam.\"\n5F. Ghost Producer (Style Transfer)\nGhost Producer is the desktop-only feature that converts Sentio from a generic instrument into your personal instrument. It uses LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) fine-tuning to teach the AI model a specific artist’s creative signature—their rhythmic swing, harmonic preferences, arrangement patterns, and sonic palette.\nPipeline\nIngest: User drags a folder of their audio files (stems, bounces, projects) into Sentio Studio.\nAnalyze: HT-Demucs separates stems. Basic Pitch extracts MIDI. Feature analysis captures: BPM distributions, key preferences, chord progression patterns, rhythmic swing values, arrangement structures, FX chain signatures.\nTrain: Unsloth + QLoRA fine-tunes a LoRA adapter on the extracted patterns. 7B model: 30–60 min on RTX 3090 (24GB VRAM, 6–8GB with QLoRA). Rank 8–16, learning rate 2e-4, 1–3 epochs.\nGenerate: User prompts AI as normal, but with LoRA adapter loaded. Output VibeBlocks reflect the user’s personal style signature.\nPackage (Optional): Artist can package their LoRA adapter as a \"Ghost Producer Kit\" for marketplace sale. Fans buy it to generate unlimited compositions in that artist’s style.\n\n6. AI Model Strategy\nSentio uses a multi-model architecture where different models serve different contexts. The core insight is that VibeBlock generation is fundamentally a structured JSON generation task, not an audio generation task. This means general-purpose LLMs with strong JSON/code capabilities are often better than music-specific models.\nRecommended Model Stack\nContext\nModel\nParameters\nSize (Quantized)\nLicense\nStrengths\nMobile (all users)\nQwen3 0.6B-Instruct\n600M\n397MB (Q4_K_M)\nApache 2.0\nGBNF grammar support, native JSON mode, 32K context, \"Thinking Mode\" for reasoning\nDesktop (standard)\nChatMusician 7B\n7B\n~4GB (Q4)\nMIT\nMusic-theory-trained on 4B tokens.

The post-Epic v Apple landscape and EU Digital Markets Act create significant opportunities.\nPlatform-Specific Payment Routing\nPlatform\nPayment Method\nCommission Paid\nLegal Basis\niOS (US)\nExternal payment link to Stripe\n~3% (Stripe only)\nEpic v Apple ruling (April 2025): US developers can embed external payment links\niOS (EU)\nAlternative payment processor via DMA\n~10–12% (Apple CTF + Store Services)\nEU Digital Markets Act: Apple must accept alt payment systems\niOS (ROW)\nApple IAP\n15–30%\nStandard App Store commission. Small Business Program = 15%.\nAndroid (US)\nThird-party payment (Stripe)\n~3%\nGoogle Play injunction (Oct 2025): external checkout permitted through Nov 2027\nAndroid (ROW)\nGoogle Play Billing\n15%\nGoogle reduced to 15% for first $1M/year\nDesktop\nStripe Direct\n~3%\nNo platform commission. Direct payment processing.\nWeb\nStripe Direct\n~3%\nNo platform commission. Web marketplace portal.\n\n\nStrategic Priority: Desktop and web purchases should be promoted aggressively—they carry only 3% payment processing versus 15–30% on mobile stores. The marketplace web portal is the highest-margin sales channel.\n8.2 Payout Mechanics\nCreators receive payouts via Stripe Connect on a monthly cycle with $10 minimum threshold. Stripe Connect handles 1099 generation for US creators and international wire transfers. For remix chains, the attribution engine calculates splits at transaction time and records them immutably in the Supabase ledger—no retroactive reconciliation needed.\n\n9. Marketplace Economics Deep Dive\n9.1 Competitive Commission Benchmarking\nPlatform\nCommission\nCreator Payout\nAsset Type\nSentio Marketplace\n30%\n70%\nVibeBlocks, CoreKits, VibeBundles, LoRA Adapters\nSplice Sounds\n~50% (subscription model)\n~50%\nAudio samples, loops, presets\nBandcamp\n15% (10% after $5K)\n85–90%\nAudio files, physical merch\nBandcamp Fridays\n0%\n100%\nAudio files (monthly event)\nApp Store\n15–30%\n70–85%\nApps, digital goods\nGumroad\n10%\n90%\nDigital goods, creative files\nAudius\n10% (node operators)\n90%\nStreamed audio (blockchain)\n\n\nWhy 70/30 is the Sweet Spot: Sentio’s 30% commission is higher than Bandcamp (15%) but dramatically more generous than Splice (~50%) and the streaming economy (<1% effective payout). The 30% covers: marketplace infrastructure (Supabase, Meilisearch, CDN), payment processing (3–5%), preview rendering + watermarking, customer support, and Sentio’s operating margin. Importantly, Sentio’s infrastructure costs are ~99% lower than audio-streaming competitors because VibeBlocks are text, not audio.\n9.2 Marketplace Flywheel\nThe marketplace creates a self-reinforcing cycle: More creators → more/better CoreKits → more interesting VibeBlocks → more listeners (Radio) → more purchases → higher creator revenue → attracts more creators. The critical insight is that Radio is the discovery engine for the marketplace. Community Radio stations surface trending VibeBlocks to passive listeners, converting Explorers into Fans who then purchase blocks and CoreKits.\n9.3 Sentio Fridays\nInspired by Bandcamp Fridays (which generated $154M+ for artists since 2020), Sentio launches \"Vibe Fridays\"—a monthly event where Sentio’s 30% commission drops to 0%. Artists keep 100% of sales (minus Stripe’s ~3% processing). This drives concentrated marketplace activity, generates social media buzz, and builds goodwill with the creator community.\n\n10. Competitive Landscape\nCompetitor\nModel\nKey Strength\nKey Weakness\nSentio Advantage\nSuno\nCloud, $2.45B valuation, ~$200M ARR\nBest vocal synthesis, Warner deal\nCloud-only, copyright lawsuits, per-generation cost\nOn-device, zero compute cost, no litigation risk\nUdio\nCloud, settled with UMG/Warner\nStrong generation quality\nDownloads disabled, pivot away from creation\nFull ownership, download/remix/resell\nSplice\nCloud marketplace, 3M+ users\nLargest sample marketplace, $105M funded\nAudio files = expensive hosting, ~50% commission\nJSON text = near-zero hosting, 70/30 split\nEndel\nOn-device ambient, $22.5M funded\nApple Watch AOTY, biometric integration\nAmbient-only, no creation tools, no marketplace\nFull music creation + marketplace + collaboration\nBeatoven.ai\nCloud, Fairly Trained certified\nEthical positioning, licensed training data\nCloud-only, limited to background music\nOn-device + full genre range + marketplace\nWotja\nOn-device generative, 2-person team\n30-year history, cross-platform\nNiche audience, no marketplace, no AI/LLM\nLLM-powered natural language, marketplace, social\n\n\nCore Strategic Moat: Sentio is the only platform combining on-device AI generation (privacy + zero compute cost), a structured JSON asset format (enabling remixing, trading, and near-zero hosting costs), and a creator-first marketplace (70/30 split). No competitor has all three. Suno has the AI but not the privacy or marketplace. Splice has the marketplace but not the AI. Endel has on-device but not creation tools or commerce.\n\n11. Phased Roadmap (8-Week MVP Sprint)\nThe 2-month timeline demands ruthless prioritization. The MVP must prove the core thesis: on-device AI can generate musically coherent VibeBlocks from natural language, rendered locally from CoreKit samples, with a working marketplace for trading them.\nPhase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1–3)\nGoal: Core engine works on mobile. User can prompt → get music.\nIntegrate Qwen3 0.6B (Q4_K_M) via llama.rn with JSI bridge\nImplement GBNF grammar constraints for VibeBlock JSON schema\nBuild Foundation CoreKit (drums, bass, pads, FX across 4 genres)\nImplement Miniaudio + Signalsmith Stretch rendering pipeline\nWatermelonDB local storage for VibeBlocks and CoreKit manifests\nBasic UI: prompt input, playback controls, VibeBlock library\nExit Criteria: User types \"chill lo-fi beat\" → AI generates valid VibeBlock → audio plays within 3 seconds on iPhone 12.\nPhase 2: Marketplace + Radio (Weeks 4–6)\nGoal: Users can discover, buy, and sell VibeBlocks. Radio provides passive listening.\nSupabase backend: auth, marketplace index, real-time sync\nStripe Connect integration: purchase flow, creator payouts, split logic\nMeilisearch for marketplace discovery (mood, genre, BPM, key)\nPoisoned Preview system: server-side render + AudioSeal watermark\nLive Radio: Pure Generative + Community Radio station types\nCommission Founder’s Packs from 10 sound designers\nEd25519 key generation + VibeBlock signing on device\nExit Criteria: Full purchase flow works. Radio plays continuously for 1 hour without interruption. 50+ VibeBlocks live on marketplace.\nPhase 3: Social + Polish (Weeks 7–8)\nGoal: Campfire Mode works. Desktop Studio alpha. Ready for beta launch.\nCampfire Mode: same-platform P2P (iOS Multipeer / Android Nearby Connections)\nRemix flow: modify purchased VibeBlocks, publish with parent_id attribution\nTauri 2.0 desktop shell + llama.cpp server mode with ChatMusician 7B\nGhost Producer V1: drag folder → analyze → LoRA train → style-aligned generation\nFree/Pro tier gating, onboarding flow, analytics (PostHog, privacy-first)\nBug fixes, performance optimization, TestFlight / internal beta distribution\nExit Criteria: Beta-ready build. Campfire works in same room. Desktop generates VibeBlocks with 7B model. Ghost Producer trains successfully on 20-file folder.\nPost-MVP Roadmap (Months 3–12)\nMonth\nFeature\nPriority\n3–4\nVST3/AU sidecar for DAW integration (JUCE)\nHigh\n3–4\nCross-platform Campfire via WebRTC\nHigh\n4–5\nArtist Radio stations + Artist Kit marketplace\nHigh\n5–6\nIntelligent Stems (HT-Demucs + Basic Pitch)\nMedium\n5–6\nRAVE/BRAVE neural timbre transfer\nMedium\n6–8\nVibe Fridays (0% commission events)\nMedium\n6–8\nFan seeding / P2P CDN with micro-credit rewards\nMedium\n8–12\nQwen 2.5 32B integration for studio tier\nLow\n8–12\nMIDI-LLM 1.47B for direct MIDI export\nLow\n10–12\nEnterprise API + white-label partnerships\nLow\n\n\n12.
