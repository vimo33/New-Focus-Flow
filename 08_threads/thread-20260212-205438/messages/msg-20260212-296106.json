  "content": "Perfect. This is **absolutely** ready for council review — it's one of the most detailed concepts I've seen. You've covered:\n\n✅ **Problem** – broken value chain, pro-rata streaming model, \"path to pennies\"  \n✅ **Users** – 4 personas (Beat Explorer, Loop Craftsman, Collage Composer, Bedroom Producer)  \n✅ **Solution** – VibeBlocks modular system, mobile performer + desktop composer  \n✅ **Differentiation** – creator-first economics, micropayments, verified identity, anti-slop  \n✅ **Success Criteria** – clear KPIs across users, revenue, engagement  \n✅ **Scope** – 8-week MVP with phased rollout  \n✅ **Technical Shape** – full architecture, AI model strategy, payment rails  \n\n**Before I send this to the council, do you want me to:**\n\n1. **Send it as-is** (full PRD for deep evaluation), or\n2. **Prepare an executive summary** (distilled version highlighting key decision points)?\n\nThe council will evaluate technical feasibility, strategic alignment, market fit, architecture, UX, and ROI. If there's a **specific area you want them to pressure-test hardest** (e.g., \"Can we really build this in 8 weeks?\" or \"Will creators actually pay for VibeBlocks?\"), let me know and I'll flag it.\n\nReady when you are.",
