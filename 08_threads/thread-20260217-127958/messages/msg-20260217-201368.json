  "content": "You have eighteen active projects. Seventeen are stuck in concept phase. Three are duplicates of the same foundation idea, two are the same Focus Flow OS.\n\nHere's what I see as a business consultant: **This isn't a portfolio. It's a graveyard of intentions.**\n\nYour revenue comes from consulting — the Orthoanalytics deal. None of these eighteen projects generate a single dollar. They're consuming attention without producing income, which directly conflicts with your current strategic directive.\n\nThe hard truth: **You don't have a project prioritization problem. You have a commitment problem.** Starting is easy. Shipping is hard. You've started eighteen times.\n\nThree options:\n\n**1. Pick One. Kill the Rest.**\nChoose the single project with the highest revenue potential per effort invested in the next 90 days. Move it from concept to spec to delivery. Archive everything else. Ruthlessly.\n\n**2. Validate Before Building.**\nBefore any project advances past concept, it needs three real conversations with people who would pay for it. Not hypothetical interest — specific budget discussions. If you can't get those conversations, the project dies.\n\n**3. Revenue Audit.**\nI pull each project, we estimate time-to-revenue and revenue potential, then rank them. You see the numbers, make the call.\n\nWhich approach do you want to take? Or do you disagree with my read and want to defend the portfolio as-is?",
