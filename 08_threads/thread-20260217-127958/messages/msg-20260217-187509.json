  "content": "Eighteen projects, seventeen stuck in concept phase. That's the problem right there.\n\nYou're spreading focus across too many early-stage ideas. With your income directive active, this portfolio needs consolidation. Here's what I see:\n\n**Immediate cleanup needed:**\n- Three \"Global Foundation\" duplicates\n- Two \"Focus Flow OS\" entries  \n- Two Bramha ESG variants\n- Two Overture entries\n\n**The revenue question:**\nOnly Mirari shows any forward motion (no phase listed, updated yesterday). The other seventeen are all concept-stage, which means none of them are generating income yet.\n\nGiven your seven thousand monthly revenue and the strategic focus on income, I'd recommend:\n\n1. **Pick your top 3** revenue-potential projects from this list\n2. **Kill or merge the duplicates** (that's 7 projects right there)\n3. **Advance one project to spec phase this week** - get it closer to something you can sell\n\nWhich of these eighteen would you bet money on? Not which sounds interesting - which one could generate revenue in the next 60 days?",
