  "content": "Seven items in your inbox need processing — two work, two personal. Six tasks pending, including two that look urgent around user research and finding a defensible wedge.\n\nHere's what I'm seeing: You've got eighteen projects at concept phase, but the dashboard doesn't tell me which one is closest to revenue. The Orthoanalytics deal closed, but what's the next income opportunity in motion?\n\nThree things worth your attention right now:\n\n1. **Clear the inbox** — those work items could be leads or follow-ups\n2. **Those urgent validation tasks** — they're blocking something. Which project are they for?\n3. **Revenue prioritization** — with eighteen projects, which 2-3 have the shortest path to paying customers?\n\nWhat do you want to tackle first?",
