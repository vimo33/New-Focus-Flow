  "content": "Right. Here's what I see:\n\n**The uncomfortable truth:** You have 18 active projects and 7,000 USD/month in revenue. That's a focus problem, not a pipeline problem. Most of these are stuck in concept phase with council scores that say \"needs work\" or \"reject.\"\n\n**What deserves your attention right now:**\n\n1. **Multiplium** — This has the clearest path to revenue as a B2B research automation tool. Investment firms, consultancies, and competitive intelligence teams will pay for this. You already have the technical depth. Package it as a service, get three paid pilots running, validate pricing. This could be 10-20k MRR within 6 months if you focus.\n\n2. **Soft Schwizz (client work)** — This is likely generating your 7k/mo. Where's the next deal? Who's in your pipeline? The Orthoanalytics win proves you can close. What's the follow-on? Can you turn them into a retainer? Can you replicate that sale motion with 3 more clients?\n\n3. **Bramha-Atlas Studio** — Competitive intelligence as a service for Swiss medtech/MEM firms. Real market, real budget, real pain. But it's concept-phase. Either validate it with 10 customer conversations in the next 30 days or shelf it.\n\n**What to pause or kill:**\n\n- The three AURA variants (4.6, 5.7 scores) — tourism/discovery apps are consumer plays that need VC money or years of grinding. You don't have either right now.\n- Global Foundation projects (multiple versions, low scores) — too early-stage, too idealistic for revenue focus.\n- Sentio, Jass Cards, Focus Flow OS — these are passion projects or tooling. They don't pay bills.\n\n**The move:** Pick 2-3 revenue-focused projects. Kill or pause the rest. Your current scatter is costing you 50-100k in unrealized income this year.\n\nWhat's your counter-argument?",
