  "content": "## Council Readiness Audit\n\nHere's how your concept maps to what the council evaluates:\n\n### ✅ **Well-covered:**\n\n- **Problem & Pain Point**: Investment research pain points are specific and credible (fragmented data, analyst bias, inconsistent methodology, shallow AI output)\n- **Vision & Positioning**: Clear strategic narrative — positioned between expensive human analysts and shallow single-LLM tools\n- **Architectural Philosophy**: Strong conceptual foundation (modularity, determinism, traceability, workflow-over-prompts)\n\n### ⚠️ **Needs strengthening:**\n\n- **Solution Mechanism**: The multi-agent approach is described philosophically, but lacks concrete workflow details — how do agents actually coordinate? What does a research run look like step-by-step?\n- **Target Users**: \"Family offices\" and \"professional investors\" are mentioned, but user segments lack depth — no personas, no validation that these users actually feel this pain acutely enough to adopt a new tool\n- **Technical Feasibility**: Orchestration and agents are referenced, but no specifics on models, data sources, platform, or integration constraints\n\n### ❌ **Missing/unclear:**\n\n- **Competitive Landscape**: No competitors or alternatives named — what exists today? Bloomberg Terminal? Pitchbook? Other AI research tools? How does Multiplium differentiate beyond philosophy?\n- **MVP Scope**: The vision spans from investment research to \"policy analysis\" and \"due diligence\" — but what ships in beta? What's the minimum viable workflow?\n- **Success Metrics**: What makes output \"decision-grade\"? How do you measure quality, correctness, or user satisfaction?\n- **Business Model**: No mention of monetization, pricing model, or path to sustainability\n- **Risks & Mitigations**: No acknowledgment of hallucination risk, data quality challenges, regulatory concerns, or cost structure\n\n---\n\n## To get this council-ready, I need to ask about:\n\n**Target users + problem validation:**\n\nThe feasibility and market-fit agents will want evidence that real users feel this pain. Right now you have a compelling *hypothesis* about investment research problems, but:\n\n- **Who specifically** has this problem? (Fund managers? Analysts at specific firm sizes? Independent investors? Family office principals?)\n- **Have you talked to any of them?** What did they say about current tools?\n- **What are they using today** that's failing them? (This feeds competitive landscape too)\n\nGive me the user story with enough detail that the council can evaluate whether there's validated demand here.",
