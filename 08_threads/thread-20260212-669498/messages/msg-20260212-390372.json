  "content": "## What I Understand So Far\n\n**Core Concept:**\nYou're building a platform for transparent, accountable immersive collective gatherings (ecstatic dance, breathwork, sound healing, etc.) — addressing fragmentation, financial opacity, and lack of ethical oversight in a growing movement.\n\n**Key Mechanisms:**\n- **Transparent sliding-scale pricing** with visible surplus redistribution\n- **Dual-token system** (reputation vs. governance power)\n- **Distributed governance** with facilitator accountability and community feedback\n- **Financial transparency** showing where money flows\n\n**Scope:**\n- Multi-city launch (Zurich, SF, Bangalore, Goa)\n- Beta validation with working MVP\n- Full system build using AI agent teams (Claude Code Opus 4.6)\n\n**Next Step:**\nYou want a **full technical specification** ready for \"council\" — presumably stakeholders, advisors, or governance body.\n\n---\n\n**What's less clear:**\n- Who exactly is \"council\" and what level of detail they need\n- Whether the spec should cover full production system or just beta MVP scope\n- Timeline/resource constraints for the AI build\n- Specific features prioritized for beta vs. later phases\n\nShould I assume the spec is for a **comprehensive production-ready system**, or focus on a **limited beta MVP** to validate core assumptions first?",
