Vision and Problem Statement\n1.1 The Opportunity\nImmersive collective gatherings such as ecstatic dance, sound journeys, breathwork circles, and conscious raves are growing in cultural relevance globally. They represent a shift toward experience-driven active engagement and community connection in an era of digital isolation. Yet this growing movement operates in a deeply fragmented ecosystem, with facilitators running events through personal WhatsApp groups, word-of-mouth networks, and inconsistent pricing structures.\n1.2 The Problem\nThe current landscape lacks standardized financial transparency or disclosure, ethical oversight and accountability mechanisms, defined governance structures, formalized community feedback systems, and trust signals for participants. This creates compounding risks: opacity around where money goes, power concentration among popular facilitators without accountability, ethical ambiguity in vulnerable settings (breathwork, sound healing), and erosion of trust as participation scales beyond intimate circles.\n1.3 The Core Insight\nThe digital world has been pulling physical communities into virtual spaces (Facebook groups, Instagram followings). This platform inverts that dynamic: it uses digital infrastructure to strengthen and scale physical community gathering. The whole purpose of the digital layer is to facilitate physical togetherness, not to replace it with screen time. Nothing on this platform is virtual. Everything leads to people being in the same room together.\n\n2. Target Users and Launch Cities\n2.1 Primary User Groups\nEvent Facilitators: Individual practitioners, established collectives, and venue owners currently operating in isolation. They use personal messaging apps, lack discovery tools for new audiences, and handle all financial logistics manually. The platform gives them a community to be discovered by, transparent financial infrastructure, and the ability to travel to new cities and be visible to local communities instantly.\nParticipants: Seekers of trustworthy, experience-driven active engagement events. They currently rely on word of mouth, have no way to verify facilitator quality, and lack visibility into event economics. The platform gives them trust signals, community-driven quality ratings, and the power to shape the events they attend.\nCommunity Ambassadors: Local stewards (2–3 per city) who facilitate facilitator verification through screening, trial events, and co-facilitation requirements. They are the bridge between the global protocol and local community culture.\n2.2 Launch Cities\nThe four initial cities were chosen because the founders have local presence and existing community connections in each. This is critical because the platform requires physical community management, not remote administration.\nCity\nContext\nPurchasing Power Index\nKey Considerations\nZurich\nHigh-trust society, direct democracy culture, established wellness scene\nHigh (baseline)\nStrong overpayment potential, high governance participation expected\nSan Francisco\nLargest existing conscious events community, tech-savvy early adopters\nHigh (similar to Zurich)\nHighest initial adoption potential, competitive landscape\nBangalore\nRapidly growing urban wellness market, tech hub, price-sensitive\nLow (5–6x gap vs. Zurich)\nDual pricing challenge, strong community culture in apartment complexes like Brigade\nGoa\nTourist economy with dual-pricing norms, established retreat culture\nLow (similar to Bangalore)\nSeasonal demand cycles, transient vs. resident population split\n\n\n2.3 Community Structure Within Cities\nBased on the design discussions, the community hierarchy operates across three levels. City-level is the primary organizational unit, with all facilitators and participants indexed by city. Interest-based subcommunities form within each city, grouping around activity types such as sound healing, ecstatic dance, breathwork, and painting. Location-based clusters emerge organically within interest groups, reflecting physical neighborhoods like the Brigade apartment complex in Bangalore, where multiple facilitators may offer similar services and participants choose based on proximity, ratings, and personal preference.\nThis means a participant in Brigade who wants sound healing will see the Bangalore sound healing subcommunity filtered by proximity, with multiple facilitators to choose from, each with their own ratings, verification tier, and transparent pricing history.\n\n3. Proposed Solution\nA nonprofit Foundation that establishes and stewards a global protocol for transparent, community-governed collective gatherings. The Foundation operates through a public charter defining transparency, ethical, and governance standards, city-based nodes with local community ambassadors, facilitator verification with progressive trust levels, independent oversight and accountability structures, economic transparency requirements for all affiliated gatherings, a skills and talent marketplace connecting facilitators with communities, and community crowdfunding to enable demand-driven event programming.\n3.1 Technical Foundation\nThe platform builds on Open Collective’s MIT-licensed open-source codebase, which provides battle-tested transparent financial infrastructure. Open Collective already enables real-time financial dashboards, expense submissions with receipts, transparent budget tracking, and fiscal hosting capabilities. The Foundation will fork this codebase and build additional layers on top: the facilitator verification and rating system, the community governance and voting mechanisms, the skills marketplace and crowdfunding engine, the event management and post-event transparency loop, and the dual-token reputation and governance system.\nOpen Collective’s existing model also aligns philosophically: when a collective on their platform does not charge for events, Open Collective does not charge either. When money flows, they take 15% of the facilitator’s share. This same principle can be adopted and refined for this platform.\n3.2 Data and Infrastructure Approach\nThe platform is intentionally lightweight on data. There is no video streaming, no audio hosting, no heavy media storage. Content is external: facilitators link to their YouTube, Instagram, or SoundCloud profiles. The platform stores primarily text, images, transaction records, and ratings. This means infrastructure costs remain low even at millions of users. A peer-to-peer or federated node architecture is feasible, where city nodes can host portions of the platform on local infrastructure, reducing centralization and keeping costs distributed.\n\n4. Economic Model and Surplus Distribution\n4.1 The Pay-What-Feels-Right Model\nThe economic model operates through a transparent sliding-scale mechanism designed in collaboration with research from Harvard Business School (which found that cost transparency increases purchase likelihood by 21%) and pay-what-you-want literature (which shows that combining PWYW with a charitable component nearly doubles average payment).\nThe participant experience unfolds across four phases. In the pre-event phase, participants see an estimated cost breakdown and a suggested average contribution. The facilitator publishes expected costs including venue rental, materials, collaborator fees, and their own time. Participants register with a commitment to pay after the event. During the event itself, the facilitator and any collaborators deliver the experience. Costs accumulate in real time on the platform as the facilitator logs actual expenses with receipts and invoices. In the post-event settlement phase, which occurs within 24 hours, participants receive a dashboard showing actual costs incurred and the average share per participant. Each participant chooses to pay at, below, or above the average, using a clear sliding scale interface. A live dashboard shows collection progress in real time. Finally, during a reconciliation window that lasts 24 hours after the event, a final summary is published. If there is a deficit, the community is invited to make up the difference. If there is a surplus, the predefined redistribution rules apply automatically. After 24 hours, no further payments are requested.\n4.2 Per-Event Revenue Flow\nDrawing from cooperative economics models used by Stocksy, Resonate, Fairbnb, and the Mondragon Corporation, the following revenue distribution applies to every event on the platform.\nRevenue Layer\nAllocation\nRationale\nFacilitator compensation\n65% of ticket revenue\nCreators capture the majority of value (Stocksy/Resonate principle)\nVenue and production costs\n15–20% (pass-through)\nActual costs verified by uploaded invoices/receipts\nPlatform fee\n15–20%\nSplit into four transparent sub-buckets detailed below\n\n\n4.3 Platform Fee Allocation\nThe platform fee itself is allocated transparently across four sub-buckets, each serving a distinct purpose in the ecosystem. Every participant can see exactly where their contribution goes.\nSub-bucket\nShare of Platform Fee\nPurpose\nPrecedent\nPlatform operations\n50%\nTechnology, administration, insurance, staff salaries\nFairbnb operational share model\nCity community fund\n25%\nLocal community initiatives, accessibility subsidies, venue improvements\nFairbnb 50/50 local community model\nGlobal commons fund\n15%\nCross-city platform development, knowledge sharing, global governance\nMondragon 14% central contribution\nReserve fund\n10%\nEmergency buffer, indivisible cooperative reserves\nICA Cooperative Principles\n\n\n4.4 Surplus Redistribution\nWhen an event collects more than its costs (including facilitator compensation), the surplus follows a predefined and transparent redistribution path. This is not arbitrary: every participant knows before the event exactly what will happen with any surplus. The facilitator receives a bonus of 30% of the surplus, recognizing that popular and high-quality facilitation should be rewarded. The city community fund receives 40%, supporting local community initiatives, subsidizing access for lower-income participants, and building shared resources. The global commons fund receives 20%, enabling cross-city knowledge transfer, platform development, and supporting newer nodes. Finally, 10% enters the reserve fund as an indivisible buffer that can never be distributed, ensuring long-term organizational resilience.\nParticipants who contributed above the average receive karma tokens proportional to their generosity, which serve as reputation signals rather than financial instruments. These tokens are detailed in Section 6.\n4.5 Expense Transparency Requirements\nEvery facilitator must upload actual cost documentation to the platform. For material costs such as venue rental, equipment, and supplies, facilitators provide invoices or receipts. For labor and time, facilitators declare hours and rates in a standardized format. The platform may incorporate expense-scanning functionality similar to tools like Fyle, reading uploaded receipts and auto-populating cost breakdowns. The community can see all expense documentation for every event, and when one facilitator charges significantly more than another for comparable venues or materials, the comparison becomes self-evident through the transparency layer.\n4.6 Can a Facilitator Make a Living?\nYes. A popular facilitator running sessions across multiple neighborhoods or cities full-time can sustain themselves because the platform fee is proportional, not fixed per event. A facilitator who runs three sessions per week at an average of 20 participants paying an average of CHF 30 in Zurich would earn approximately CHF 5,850 per month from facilitation alone (65% of gross). In Bangalore, at equivalent purchasing-power-adjusted rates of approximately 500 INR per participant, the same activity pattern yields roughly INR 78,000 per month. The platform also does not create incentives to take communities off-platform, because the facilitator gains discovery, reputation, cross-city visibility, and financial infrastructure they cannot replicate with a WhatsApp group.\n\n5. Skills Marketplace and Community Crowdfunding\n5.1 The Marketplace Concept\nThe skills and talent marketplace is a discovery layer where facilitators create rich profiles showcasing their abilities, experience, and body of work. It serves three critical functions. First, it solves the cold-start problem for facilitators traveling to new cities: a Distinguished sound healer from Goa becomes instantly visible to the Zurich community without needing to build a local WhatsApp network from scratch. Second, it enables communities to browse available talent when commissioning events through crowdfunding. Third, it creates a portfolio and reputation layer that makes facilitator quality visible and comparable.\n5.2 Facilitator Profile Structure\nEach marketplace profile contains several layers of information. The identity and verification layer shows the facilitator’s name, photo, location and travel availability, verification tier (Entry, Established, Distinguished, or Elder), and verification date. The skills and modalities section lists what they offer, whether that is ecstatic dance DJ sets, sound healing with singing bowls and gongs, holotropic breathwork facilitation, cacao ceremonies, movement therapy, or art workshops. The portfolio section links to external content such as YouTube videos, Instagram reels, SoundCloud mixes, and personal websites, as well as any on-platform event recordings or photo galleries. The platform track record shows the number of events facilitated, average participant rating, community endorsements from other verified facilitators, and transparent pricing history including average cost per participant across past events. Finally, the availability and rates section shows the facilitator’s calendar, base rate expectations, and willingness to accept crowdfunded or sliding-scale-only events.\nProfiles exist in two states. An unverified profile is open to anyone and clearly marked as such, allowing facilitators to showcase their work and be discovered but with a visible trust gap. A verified profile requires completing the platform’s onboarding process of screening, trial events, and co-facilitation, and carries the corresponding tier badge. Communities can engage either type, but verified facilitators naturally attract more trust and crowdfunding support.\n5.3 Community Crowdfunding\nThis mechanism flips the traditional event model. Instead of a facilitator announcing an event and hoping people come, a community collectively decides what experience they want and funds it into existence. The flow works as follows.\nIn the proposal phase, any community member can propose an event concept, for example: \"We want a cacao ceremony with live music in Brigade next Saturday evening.\" The proposal includes the type of experience, preferred date and location, and an estimated budget range. In the crowdfunding phase, community members pledge contributions toward the event’s minimum viable budget, which covers venue, materials, and a guaranteed facilitator base fee. The sliding-scale model applies to pledges, so participants contribute what feels right. A progress bar shows funding status, and the event activates once the minimum budget is reached. During the matching phase, once funded, the community either selects a specific facilitator from the marketplace or opens it to proposals from interested facilitators. The community can review marketplace profiles, watch portfolio content, and compare transparent pricing histories before selecting. In the case of multi-provider events, a lead facilitator can assemble an ensemble from the marketplace, for example pairing a sound healer with a live musician. The full team and cost breakdown are visible to funders before final confirmation. After the event, the standard post-event transparency loop applies: actual costs are disclosed, the sliding scale settles individual contributions, and any surplus follows the predefined redistribution rules.\n5.4 Cross-City Commissioning\nOne of the most powerful features enabled by the marketplace is cross-city commissioning. The Zurich community can crowdfund bringing a Distinguished facilitator from Goa for a special event, with the marketplace handling discovery and the platform handling transparent economics including travel cost allocation. This creates opportunities for facilitators to build a global following and for communities to access talent beyond their local pool, while keeping all economics visible and community-governed.\n5.5 Interaction with the Token System\nThe marketplace creates additional surfaces for the reputation economy. Community members who contribute to crowdfunding campaigns earn karma for community building. Facilitators who accept crowdfunded gigs, which may pay less than private bookings, earn karma for accessibility and community service. Facilitators who offer reduced rates or donate their time earn karma that translates into better platform visibility, accelerated tier progression, and stronger governance participation rights. The marketplace and crowdfunding layer thus reinforce the platform’s core value proposition: the more you contribute to the community, the more the community recognizes and elevates you.\n\n6. Dual Token System: Karma and Voice\nThe platform uses two distinct token types to separate reputation from governance power. This design is grounded in research from SourceCred’s dual-token architecture, a16z’s framework for reputation-based systems, and the universal cooperative principle that money must never buy votes.\n6.1 Karma Tokens (Reputation)\nKarma tokens are non-transferable reputation signals that reflect a member’s contribution to the community. They cannot be bought, sold, or traded. They are earned exclusively through verified actions on the platform.\nKarma is earned through several channels. Attendance consistency rewards regular event participation, with recurring attendance earning more than sporadic visits. Financial generosity recognizes those who pay above the sliding-scale average, without exposing exact amounts; the system shows that someone was generous, not how generous. Volunteering covers practical community contributions like event setup, teardown, greeting, sound checks, and space holding. Community building recognizes bringing new members to the platform and facilitating connections. Crowdfunding contribution rewards those who fund community-proposed events through the marketplace. Content contribution covers sharing playlists, writing event guidelines, creating community resources, and facilitating knowledge exchange.\nA critical design principle is that karma must decay over time. An exponential decay with a 90-day half-life ensures that governance rights reflect current engagement rather than historical accumulation. Reputation earned three months ago counts half as much as today’s contribution. This prevents early adopters from permanently dominating governance and keeps the system oriented toward active participation. Weekly earning caps per category prevent binge-accumulation, and the financial generosity category is specifically capped at 2x the standard contribution equivalent to prevent wealthy participants from gaming the reputation system.\n6.2 Voice Tokens (Governance)\nVoice tokens represent governance participation rights. They are activated by reaching a karma threshold, not by purchasing them. The activation criteria require a minimum of three events attended and contributions in at least two karma categories. Once activated, the baseline principle for constitutional decisions is one-member-one-vote, following the universal cooperative principle that decouples governance from capital contribution.\nFor resource allocation and prioritization decisions, the platform uses quadratic voting, where each member receives a budget of voice credits that convert to votes via square root. Casting one vote costs one credit, but casting two votes on the same issue costs four credits and three votes costs nine. This means a person with 100 times the resources gets only 10 times the voting power, significantly reducing the influence of concentrated interests while still allowing people to express intensity of preference.\nFor ongoing community decisions, conviction voting allows members to stake their voice tokens on proposals, with conviction accumulating over time like a capacitor charging. This transforms vote-buying into continuous-cost vote-renting and ensures that long-held community preferences accumulate more weight than sudden interventions. These mechanisms are not blockchain-dependent; they can be implemented as database-level logic on the Open Collective codebase.\n6.3 What Tokens Are Not\nTo be explicit about boundaries: karma tokens are not cryptocurrency and have no monetary value. They cannot be traded on any exchange. Voice tokens are not shares and confer no ownership or profit rights. Neither token type can be purchased with money. The platform is deliberately positioned outside the blockchain and cryptocurrency ecosystem to avoid association with speculative token economics and to maintain focus on real-world community building.\n6.4 Practical Token Uses\nBeyond governance, karma tokens unlock practical benefits. They can be redeemed for discounted or free event access, essentially functioning as community credit for future experiences. Facilitators with high karma earn priority in marketplace visibility and tier advancement. Community members with strong karma can access ambassador roles and event co-facilitation opportunities. Volunteers who accumulate karma through service can attend events funded by the community fund at reduced or zero cost, creating an economic solidarity loop.\n\n7. Facilitator Verification and Tiered Advancement\n7.1 Tier System\nTier\nRequirements\nBenefits\nAdvancement\nEntry\nComplete screening, submit portfolio, run one trial event with co-facilitation\nListed in marketplace (with Entry badge), access to community events calendar, basic financial tools\nAutomatic after 5+ rated events with average rating above threshold\nEstablished\n5+ successful events, consistent positive ratings, expense transparency compliance\nPriority marketplace visibility, access to premium venues through platform partnerships, featured in city discovery\nCommunity nomination plus 10+ events with strong ratings\nDistinguished\n10+ events, community nomination, demonstrated contribution to community beyond facilitation\nCross-city visibility, eligible for crowdfunded travel commissions, mentoring role for Entry facilitators\nCommunity-wide vote with 2/3 supermajority\nElder\nSustained distinguished-level contribution, recognized by multiple city nodes\nGovernance advisory role, shape platform evolution, priority access to all venue partnerships, ambassador eligibility\nGlobal community vote\n\n\n7.2 Onboarding Flow\nA new facilitator joins the platform by creating a marketplace profile with their skills, modalities, portfolio links, and availability. They undergo an initial screening by city community ambassadors, which includes a conversation about the platform’s principles and economic model. They then run a trial event, co-facilitated with an Established or higher-tier facilitator, where participants provide structured feedback. Upon successful completion, they receive their Entry tier badge and full marketplace access. One design option discussed is requiring new facilitators to bring at least 10 participants to their first platform event, serving as a built-in community-building requirement and ensuring that every new facilitator immediately contributes to platform growth.\n7.3 Quality Assurance\nQuality is maintained through multiple feedback mechanisms. Post-event ratings from participants are structured to capture specific dimensions of the experience rather than a single star rating. Community ambassadors conduct periodic reviews of facilitator compliance with transparency and ethical standards. The marketplace’s transparent pricing history naturally exposes facilitators who consistently overcharge relative to their peers. And the tier advancement system, which requires community votes for the highest levels, ensures that sustained quality and contribution are recognized and rewarded.\n8. Constitutional Framework and Governance\nThe platform’s governance operates through a four-layer document architecture with escalating amendment thresholds, drawing from Burning Man’s 10 Principles, B Corp certification standards, Enspiral’s agreements framework, and sociocratic consent-based decision-making.\n8.1 Layer 1: Core Values (Hardest to Change)\nThe foundational values emerge from the organic culture of the ecstatic dance and conscious events community. They are aspirational and cultural, not prescriptive rules. The initial proposed values include Embodiment (prioritizing physical, present, sensory experience), Radical Inclusivity (accessible to all regardless of economic status, background, or ability), Consent Culture (clear boundaries in all interactions, especially in vulnerable settings), Transparent Economics (every financial flow visible to every participant), Community Sovereignty (decisions made by participants, not centralized management), Ecological Stewardship (every event considers its sustainability footprint), and Active Participation (everyone contributes, no one is merely an audience). Amending core values requires 80% or higher supermajority approval with a 6-month deliberation period and at least 50% quorum of active members.\n8.2 Layer 2: Charter and Bylaws\nThe charter defines the Foundation’s legal structure, membership classes (facilitators, participants, platform workers), one-member-one-vote provisions, board composition with staggered terms, and the economic model’s structural parameters. This layer follows the B Corp model of Foundation Requirements (universal prerequisites) plus Impact Topics (context-dependent standards that can evolve). Amending the charter requires a two-thirds supermajority with a 30-day notification period.\n8.3 Layer 3: Agreements and Policies\nOperational agreements function as community legislation, following Enspiral’s model where any member can raise a formal decision at any time. A decision passes when the majority agrees and nobody blocks. A block is a strong form of disagreement requiring the blocker to explain their concern and propose improvements. This consent-based approach, borrowed from sociocracy, shifts the question from whether everyone agrees to whether there are reasons not to proceed. Decisions are framed as good enough for now and safe enough to try, with all agreements carrying a scheduled review date.\n8.4 Layer 4: Guidelines and Guides\nNon-binding best practices updated by working groups or designated stewards. The ecstatic dance community has already developed remarkably consistent guidelines globally: no shoes on the dance floor, substance-free space, no talking on the dance floor, no phones, consent-based touch. These function as cultural norms rather than enforceable rules and evolve organically as communities grow.\n8.5 Scope Boundary and Evolution\nThe initial scope boundary defines what belongs on the platform. In scope: experience-driven active engagement events where participants are physically present and actively involved. This includes movement practices such as ecstatic dance, contact improvisation, and movement therapy; sonic experiences such as sound healing, live music circles, and chanting; breathwork in all its forms; creative workshops such as painting, pottery, and collaborative art; wellness practices such as yoga, meditation, and cacao ceremonies; nature-based experiences such as forest bathing and outdoor movement; community gatherings with an active component such as potlucks with shared cooking or community gardening; and family and child-friendly activities. Out of scope: passive consumption events where the primary mode is watching or listening without active engagement, such as concerts, lectures, and film screenings. Also out of scope: traditional profit-maximizing event management, events that violate core values such as substance use, lack of consent culture, or closed governance, and purely virtual events with no physical gathering component.\nWhen a community member proposes expanding the scope to include a new activity type, a structured process applies. First, a values alignment check tests the proposal against Layer 1 core values. Then a 4–6 week community deliberation period allows discussion and refinement. A 6-month pilot with defined success metrics can be approved by simple majority. Finally, a formal vote on permanent inclusion based on pilot data requires a two-thirds supermajority. Activities that would violate core values can only be added through the Layer 1 amendment process requiring 80% approval.\n\n9. Organizational Sustainability\n9.1 The Non-Profit Commitment\nThe Foundation is structured as a non-profit. There are no shares and no shareholders. Nobody gets paid because equity increases in value. Founders and staff are compensated with salaries for the value they create, not for ownership stakes. The organization is not optimizing for an exit or acquisition. It is designed to eventually be governed entirely by its communities.\n9.2 Revenue Model\nThe Foundation sustains itself through the platform fee on each event transaction (15–20% of ticket revenue, with 50% of that fee covering operations). For free events where no money changes hands, the platform charges nothing, following the Open Collective principle. Additional revenue streams may include premium venue partnership commissions, optional premium tools for high-volume facilitators, and grants or donations from aligned foundations and organizations. The Foundation publishes quarterly financial reports with full narrative context, following Enspiral’s practice of storytelling alongside accounting.\n9.3 Path to Community Governance\nThe founding team governs the platform during Year 1 while establishing the initial community and testing assumptions. In Year 2, governance transitions begin: city nodes gain autonomy over local decisions, facilitator and participant representatives join the governing board, and community voting mechanisms activate for policy decisions. By Year 3 and beyond, the Foundation is governed by its communities through the constitutional framework described in Section 8, with the founding team holding no more authority than any other active community members.\n\n10. Assumptions Testing Framework\nBefore building any technology, the platform must validate its core assumptions through structured experiments. The following framework identifies the riskiest assumptions, designs minimum viable experiments to test each one, and defines clear success criteria. All initial testing should be conducted using existing tools: Google Forms for registration, WhatsApp for community coordination, Google Sheets for transparent economics, and in-person events for the actual gatherings.\n10.1 The Five Core Experiments\nExperiment 1: Sliding-Scale Willingness to Pay\nAssumption: People will voluntarily pay at or above the average cost when given a transparent cost breakdown and a sliding scale.\nDesign: Run an A/B test across 10+ events in two cities. Group A pays a fixed price set at the intended scale’s midpoint. Group B uses a sliding scale with a transparent cost breakdown showing venue, facilitator, platform, and community fund allocations. Group C uses a sliding scale without the breakdown, showing only the range.\nMetrics: Average payment per group, percentage paying at minimum, percentage paying above midpoint, total revenue per event, and post-event satisfaction scores.\nSuccess Criteria: Average payment in the transparent sliding-scale group (B) reaches 90% or more of the fixed-price group (A), with 25% or fewer paying at minimum and 15% or more paying above midpoint.\nMinimum Sample: 30 attendees per condition per city.\nExperiment 2: Facilitator Acceptance and Sustainability\nAssumption: Facilitators will accept transparent economics, community ratings, and sliding-scale impact on their income.\nDesign: Interview 15–20 facilitators across cities about concerns with transparency and community oversight. Then offer 5–8 facilitators a 3-event pilot with a guaranteed minimum fee plus sliding-scale upside.\nSuccess Criteria: 60% or more of interviewed facilitators express interest, 80% or more of pilot facilitators complete all three events, and average compensation reaches 90% or more of their typical rate.\nExperiment 3: Transparency’s Effect on Payment Behavior\nAssumption: Showing a detailed cost breakdown increases willingness to pay above the minimum.\nDesign: Within the sliding-scale condition from Experiment 1, compare the full cost breakdown group (B) against the scale-only group (C). Track whether seeing where money goes changes payment behavior.\nSuccess Criteria: The transparent condition yields 10% or higher average payment than the non-transparent sliding scale. This directly validates the Harvard Business School finding in a live events context.\nExperiment 4: Governance Participation Rates\nAssumption: Community members will actively participate in governance decisions, not just attend events passively.\nDesign: Implement a progressive engagement funnel. Start with a 2-minute post-event feedback form targeting 50% or higher completion. Introduce monthly online polls on event decisions targeting 25% or higher participation. Hold quarterly community meetings targeting 10% or higher attendance. Conduct annual governance votes targeting 15% or higher turnout.\nSuccess Criteria: Meeting or exceeding each funnel target within the first 6 months of operation. Begin with tangible, low-stakes decisions like choosing next month’s event genre before graduating to financial allocation decisions.\nExperiment 5: Platform Discovery vs. Informal Networks\nAssumption: The platform provides meaningful discovery value beyond existing WhatsApp groups and word-of-mouth.\nDesign: Run 5–10 events using only existing tools before building any technology. Track what percentage of attendees discover events through the platform’s channels versus personal networks. Measure whether the platform’s trust signals, such as facilitator ratings and transparency, influence attendance decisions.\nSuccess Criteria: 20% or more of discovery through platform channels by event 5, repeat attendance at 40% or higher, and Net Promoter Score at 50 or above.\n10.2 Crowdfunding Assumption Test\nAssumption: Communities will proactively propose and crowdfund events rather than waiting for facilitators to announce them.\nDesign: After 10+ standard events have established a participant base, post 3 community proposals in a WhatsApp group with simple Google Forms pledge forms. Proposals should span different activity types and budget levels. Track pledge rates, funding completion speed, and whether the resulting events have higher satisfaction than facilitator-initiated events.\nSuccess Criteria: At least 2 of 3 proposals reach minimum funding within 7 days, with average pledges at or above the sliding-scale midpoint.\n10.3 The North Star Metric\nAcross all experiments, track revenue-weighted repeat attendance: the sliding-scale revenue contributed by returning attendees. This single metric captures both financial sustainability (are people paying enough?) and community health (are they coming back?). Supplement with facilitator NPS (would they recommend the platform to peers?), community fund generation per event, and governance participation rates at each funnel level.\n\n11. Success Criteria and Year 1 Timeline\n11.1 Year 1 Milestones\nQuarter\nMilestone\nKey Deliverables\nQ1\nAssumptions Testing\nRun 5 core experiments across Bangalore and one other city using existing tools. Validate sliding-scale economics, facilitator acceptance, and governance participation. Document learnings.\nQ2\nMVP Platform Launch\nFork Open Collective codebase. Build minimum viable marketplace, event creation, post-event transparency dashboard, and basic rating system. Launch operational nodes in 2 cities.\nQ3\nMulti-City Expansion\nExpand to all 4 cities. Onboard initial cohort of verified facilitators per city. Launch community crowdfunding. Activate karma token tracking.\nQ4\nGovernance Activation\nImplement community voting mechanisms. Conduct first community-wide governance decisions. Publish first annual transparency report. Assess Year 2 strategy based on data.\n\n\n11.2 Year 1 Success Criteria\nBy the end of Year 1, the platform should have launched operational nodes in all 4 cities simultaneously, verified an initial cohort of at least 10 facilitators per city, achieved a minimum of 50 events with 20 or more participants each, demonstrated that the sliding-scale model sustains facilitator compensation at 90% or more of market rates, established functional community voting with 15% or higher participation, generated measurable community fund balances in each city node, and onboarded at least 20 facilitator profiles in the marketplace with at least one successful cross-city crowdfunded event.\n11.3 Budget\nYear 1 budget is estimated at $200,000–$300,000, covering platform development (forking and building on Open Collective), community ambassador stipends across 4 cities, legal setup for the non-profit Foundation, initial event subsidies during the testing phase, and operational overhead. Detailed financial projections will be developed following assumptions testing in Q1.\n\n12. Position on AI and Technology\nThe platform takes a deliberate and cautious approach to artificial intelligence. While AI tools can help facilitators with operational tasks like creating event descriptions, generating social media posts, or analyzing feedback patterns, the platform does not position AI as a core feature or selling point. This is a conscious decision for several reasons.\nThe community this platform serves values human connection, embodiment, and present-moment experience. Foregrounding AI risks creating associations with opacity and algorithmic control that contradict the platform’s transparency values. The current cultural discourse around AI includes concerns about data centers, energy consumption, and job displacement that could alienate the target community. The platform’s core value proposition is community-controlled governance, and introducing AI-driven recommendation or curation systems would undermine that principle.\nAI may be used behind the scenes for tasks like expense receipt scanning, automated compliance checking when events are created (ensuring they meet community guidelines), or helping facilitators draft event descriptions. But it should remain invisible infrastructure, not a marketed feature. The platform’s intelligence comes from its community, not its algorithms.\n\n13. What We Do Not Do\nDefining boundaries is as important as defining features. The platform explicitly does not host passive consumption events where the primary mode is watching or listening without active participation. It does not operate as a traditional profit-maximizing event management company. It does not launch as a single-city pilot but rather launches across 4 cities simultaneously to test multi-city dynamics from day one. It does not host purely virtual events or replace physical gathering with digital interaction. It does not use blockchain tokens, cryptocurrency, or any speculative token economics. It does not sell user data or display advertising. It does not create algorithmic recommendation systems that override community-driven discovery. And it does not allow any individual, including founders, to accumulate ownership equity or profit from the platform’s growth beyond fair salary compensation for value created.\n\n14. Next Steps\nThe immediate next actions coming out of this document are as follows. First, design the first event in Bangalore as a structured assumptions test, incorporating the sliding-scale A/B framework from Experiment 1 and basic transparency mechanics using Google Sheets and WhatsApp. Second, draft the Platform Charter (Layer 2 document) defining the legal structure, membership classes, and amendment procedures. Third, conduct facilitator interviews across all four cities to validate Experiment 2 assumptions. Fourth, deep-dive into the Open Collective codebase to assess forking feasibility and identify the technical effort required for marketplace and crowdfunding extensions. Fifth, begin writing the community constitution (Layer 1 values document) as a living draft open for community input from the earliest participants.
