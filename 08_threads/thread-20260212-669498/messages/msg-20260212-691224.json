  "content": "This is remarkably thorough — you've clearly thought deeply about the economic model, governance structure, and cultural dynamics. The transparent sliding-scale approach with surplus redistribution is compelling, and the dual-token system shows sophistication around separating reputation from power.\n\nOne tension I notice: You emphasize testing assumptions with simple tools (Google Forms, WhatsApp, Sheets) before building technology, but you're also planning to launch across 4 cities simultaneously in Year 1. That's a lot of operational complexity to manage manually while validating core assumptions.\n\n**How do you plan to maintain quality and gather comparable data across 4 very different cultural contexts (Zurich, SF, Bangalore, Goa) during the testing phase — especially when purchasing power, trust culture, and community organizing norms vary so dramatically between them?**",
