  "content": "# Kavach AI — Council Assessment\n\n**Overall Score:** 5.4/10  \n**Verdict:** Needs Info (not rejected — fixable gaps)\n\nYour edge-first workplace safety monitoring platform for Indian factories is **substantive and well-researched**, but has three critical blockers and two execution risks that need resolution before launch.\n\n---\n\n## 🚨 **Critical Blockers (Must Fix)**\n\n### 1. **Legal Compliance Gap** (Score: 4/10)\n- **NO worker consent mechanism** despite DPDP Rules 2025 requirements\n- Anonymization deferred to \"Phase 2\" when it should be MVP core\n- Zero transparency protocol (no DSAR, no appeals, no retention policy)\n- Liability split between plant and vendor completely undefined\n- **This is a legal blocker, not just a risk**\n\n### 2. **Hardware Economics Fragility** (Score: 5/10)\n- Edge appliances cost $5-18k (NVIDIA L4 GPUs at $3-5k each)\n- Lease revenue requires 24+ months retention just to recover COGS\n- Camera capacity claims (16/32/50) likely **30-50% optimistic** in real conditions\n- ₹3-5k \"starter kit\" is economically incoherent — can't include edge hardware at that price\n- No budget for on-prem support (GPU failures, site visits at ₹10-30k each)\n\n### 3. **Deployment Reality Gap** (Score: 6/10)\n- ONVIF \"compliance\" is fragmented in practice (buggy implementations, locked RTSP)\n- **30-min readiness assessment will likely reveal 30-50% of cameras need upgrades** — breaks ROI promise\n- 7-day SLA incompatible with IT approval cycles (firewall rules, VLAN policies take weeks)\n- No remote diagnostic tooling for self-serve transition\n- IT gatekeeper resistance acknowledged but not mitigated\n\n---\n\n## ⚠️ **Execution Risks (Validate Before Scale)**\n\n### 4. **CV Performance** (Score: 6/10)\n- 95% precision only applies to \"green-ready\" cameras\n- Public Western datasets create domain gap for India-specific PPE\n- <2 false alerts/shift is very tight — unmet targets will erode trust\n\n### 5. **Sales Assumptions** (Score: 6/10)\n- Conversion rates (25-40% assessment→pilot, 50-70% pilot→annual) are **1.5-2x industry benchmarks** without validation\n- EHS champion lacks budget authority; IT gatekeepers have veto power with no approval strategy\n- Integrator channel conflict unresolved (why promote solution competing with camera upsell?)\n\n---\n\n## ✅ **What's Strong**\n\n- Edge-first architecture is the right choice\n- Competitive analysis is concrete (Visionify $3k + $200/mo, Intenseye $500/cam/year)\n- Business model is now complete (₹6-18L ACV for 20-cam plant)\n- Conservative Phase 1 rollout (4 installs, assisted setup) manages early risk\n- 30-min readiness assessment is genuinely differentiated\n\n---\n\n## 🎯 **Priority Actions**\n\n**Before you can advance to feasibility:**\n\n1. **Engage Indian data privacy counsel** — design worker consent, DSAR, liability allocation, move anonymization to MVP\n2. **Stress-test hardware economics** — model 30-50% lower camera capacity, support costs, retention sensitivity (70% vs 85%)\n3. **Pre-pilot with 2-3 friendly sites** — measure actual ONVIF readiness, deployment time, IT friction, upgrade rates\n4. **Validate sales conversion** — run 10-15 real readiness assessments, measure actual conversion vs assumptions\n5. **Fix or kill starter kit** — ₹3-5k pricing is incoherent; either reprice at ₹50k-1L or remove entirely\n\n---\n\n**Bottom line:** This isn't a rejection — the concept is solid and you've done strong research. But launching without fixing worker consent, validating hardware economics, and stress-testing deployment assumptions would be reckless. The council is saying: **solve these three blockers, then come back.**\n\nWant to work through any of these gaps together?",
