  "content": "I need to understand your context first. Let me check what projects you have and who you are.\n\nVimo, you have 18 projects listed as active — most stuck in concept phase. Before I map out build requirements, I need clarity on three things:\n\n**1. Which projects are you actually committed to building?**\nNot all 18. That would fragment your focus to nothing. Which 2-3 are worth real execution time right now?\n\n**2. What does \"build\" mean for each?**\n- Working MVP?\n- Technical spec + design?\n- Proof-of-concept prototype?\n- Just scaffolding to validate the idea?\n\n**3. What's your constraint — time, money, or skill gaps?**\nThe build plan changes completely depending on whether you're solo-building, hiring devs, or need to raise capital first.\n\nLooking at your portfolio, the ones closest to revenue potential appear to be:\n- **Mirari (AURA - Zurich Temporal Lens)** — unclear phase but named distinctly\n- **Kavach AI** — concept phase\n- **Orthoanalytics** — you have a closed deal at $9k, is there build work remaining?\n\nWant to start by focusing on which projects actually generate income fastest? That's where my directive sits right now.",
