  "content": "Good — you're shifting from \"here's my plan\" to \"let's validate assumptions.\" That's the right instinct.\n\nHere's a practical validation framework:\n\n## 1. Sector Selection Criteria (Score Each 1-5)\n\n**Access:**\n- Do you have warm intros to 10+ potential buyers?\n- Can you reach decision-makers without gatekeepers?\n- Are there active communities/associations you can tap?\n\n**Pain Acuteness:**\n- Is the problem costing them measurable money *right now*?\n- Are they already paying for partial solutions?\n- Is there a regulatory/market deadline creating urgency?\n\n**Buying Power:**\n- Do they have budget authority under CHF 25K (no board approval)?\n- Are they already spending on adjacent tools?\n- Is the category in their approved vendor list?\n\n**Your Edge:**\n- Do you understand their workflow better than competitors?\n- Can you deliver 10x faster/cheaper on a specific sub-task?\n- Is there a structural reason you can win (like India expertise)?\n\n## 2. Workflow Discovery Method\n\n**Don't ask \"what do you need?\" — shadow actual work:**\n\n1. **Get 5-8 interviews with target personas** (export managers, market intelligence leads, strategy directors)\n2. **Ask them to walk you through their last 3 months:**\n   - \"Walk me through the last time you entered a new market\"\n   - \"Show me how you track competitors today\" (screen share)\n   - \"What report did you deliver to your CEO last quarter?\"\n3. **Map the painful steps:**\n   - Where do they spend >2 hours on manual work?\n   - Where do they pay external consultants?\n   - Where do they make decisions with incomplete data?\n\n**The magic question:** *\"If I could wave a wand and automate one part of your workflow, which would save you the most time or money?\"*\n\n## 3. Willingness-to-Pay Validation\n\n**Test real behavior, not stated intent:**\n\n- **Anchoring test:** \"S-GE provides X for free. What would make you pay CHF 15K for something else?\"\n- **Budget reality check:** \"What did you spend on market research / compliance tools / consulting last year?\" (If answer is <CHF 10K, your pricing is too high)\n- **Substitution test:** \"If this existed, what would you stop buying?\"\n- **Pain severity:** \"How much revenue did you lose / leave on table because you lacked this intelligence?\" (If they can't quantify, pain isn't acute)\n\n**The validation milestone:**\nGet **3 companies to commit to a paid pilot** (even CHF 5K for 3 months). If you can't get 3 pilots from 30 conversations, the problem isn't painful enough or your solution doesn't fit.\n\n## 4. The Council Meeting Structure\n\n**Goal: Make a sector + workflow decision by end of meeting**\n\n**Prep work (before council):**\n- Complete 5-8 customer discovery interviews\n- Map 3-5 workflows with time/cost/pain scores\n- Identify which workflows people are *already paying* to solve\n\n**Meeting agenda:**\n1. **Present interview findings** (20 min) — raw quotes, actual workflows\n2. **Score sectors** (15 min) — use the 4 criteria above\n3. **Debate willingness-to-pay evidence** (20 min) — what's real vs. polite interest?\n4. **Pick ONE sector + ONE workflow** (5 min) — commit to testing a pilot\n\n**Walk out with:**\n- Target: [Sector + company size + persona]\n- Problem: [Specific workflow that costs them CHF X in time/money]\n- Test: [Pilot offer to 10 companies in next 30 days]\n\n---\n\n**The real question:** Before you gather the council, can you get 5 export managers / market intelligence leads from medtech or MEM companies on a call this week to walk through their actual workflow?\n\nIf not, your go-to-market is theory. You need those conversations first.",
