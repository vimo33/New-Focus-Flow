Two accessible companies is enough to learn whether your thesis holds water.\n\n**But don't propose a pilot yet.** You'll waste the opportunity if you pitch before you understand their actual workflow and pain.\n\n---\n\n## The Discovery Sequence (Do This First)\n\n### Step 1: Schedule \"workflow research\" calls (not sales calls)\n\n**Your framing:**\n> \"I'm researching how Swiss medtech companies handle competitive intelligence and market entry — specifically around TEPA/India, regulatory changes, and competitor tracking. Can I get 30-45 minutes to walk through how your team currently handles this? Not selling anything — genuinely trying to map the workflow.\"\n\n**Why this works:** You're positioning as researcher, not vendor. They'll be more honest.\n\n### Step 2: The Discovery Interview (30-45 min)\n\n**Part A: Current State Mapping (15 min)**\n\n1. **\"Walk me through the last time you evaluated entering a new market.\"**\n   - Who was involved? How long did it take?\n   - What sources did you use? (S-GE, consultants, internal research, DIY Google?)\n   - What did you deliver at the end? (Report? Recommendation? Decision?)\n\n2. **\"How do you currently track competitors?\"**\n   - Show me your process (ask for screen share if virtual)\n   - How often? Who does it? How is it shared internally?\n   - What tools/subscriptions do you use? (Google Alerts? Paid platforms? Nothing?)\n\n3. **\"How do you stay on top of regulatory changes — MDR, CBAM, AI Act, India certifications?\"**\n   - Who owns this? How much time does it take?\n   - Have you been surprised by a regulatory change that cost you time/money?\n\n**Part B: Pain Discovery (15 min)**\n\n4. **\"Where in this process do you feel most blind or behind?\"**\n   - Competitor moves? Pricing changes? Regulatory shifts? Market trends?\n\n5. **\"What's the cost when you miss something?\"**\n   - Lost deal? Delayed market entry? Compliance scramble?\n   - Can you give me a specific example from the last 12 months?\n\n6. **\"If you could automate or outsource ONE part of this workflow, what would it be?\"**\n   - Listen for time spent vs. value delivered\n   - Note if they mention existing attempts to solve this (tools, consultants, internal hires)\n\n**Part C: Buying Reality Check (10 min)**\n\n7. **\"What do you currently spend on market intelligence, competitive research, or consulting?\"**\n   - Annual budget? (If <CHF 10K, your CHF 15-25K pricing is DOA)\n   - What do they pay for now? (S-GE reports? Big 4 consulting? Subscriptions?)\n\n8. **\"If a tool existed that did [repeat their earlier pain point], what would make it worth paying for vs. using free options?\"**\n   - Listen for: \"saves me X hours/week\" or \"helps us win Y more deals\" or \"keeps us compliant\"\n\n9. **\"Who controls budget for this kind of purchase? What's the approval process under CHF 20K?\"**\n\n**Part D: TEPA Validation (5 min)**\n\n10. **\"Are you evaluating India as a market because of TEPA? If yes, what's your biggest uncertainty?\"**\n   - This tests if your India-focused positioning is real demand or your wishful thinking\n\n---\n\n## What You're Listening For\n\n**🟢 Strong signals (real pain):**\n- \"We pay [consultant/tool] CHF X/year but it doesn't cover Y\"\n- \"We lost a deal because we didn't know competitor Z launched feature W\"\n- \"I spend 5-10 hours/week manually tracking this\"\n- \"We got hit with an MDR requirement we missed — cost us 3 months\"\n- Concrete budget numbers above CHF 10K/year for adjacent problems\n\n**🟡 Medium signals (polite interest):**\n- \"Yeah, that would be nice to have\"\n- \"We mostly use S-GE and Google, works okay\"\n- \"Our CEO asks about this sometimes but it's not urgent\"\n\n**🔴 Red flags (no real pain):**\n- \"We don't really track competitors actively\"\n- Budget <CHF 5K/year for all external intelligence\n- \"S-GE provides most of what we need\"\n- Can't name a specific instance where lack of CI cost them money\n\n---\n\n## After 2 Interviews: Decision Point\n\n### If you hear 🟢 signals from both companies:\n\n**Then propose a structured pilot:**\n\n> \"Based on what you shared — especially [specific pain point they mentioned] — I'm building a CI platform focused on Swiss medtech. Would you be open to a 3-month pilot where I deliver:\n> \n> - Weekly competitor intelligence briefs (automated)\n> - Regulatory change alerts (MDR, AI Act, CBAM, India BIS)\n> - TEPA/India market entry intelligence dashboard\n> \n> In exchange: your feedback on what's useful vs. noise, and a testimonial if it works.\n> \n> No cost for the pilot. If it saves you [X hours/week] or helps you [avoid Y cost], we can discuss a paid engagement.\"\n\n### If you hear 🟡 or 🔴 signals:\n\n**Don't pitch. Instead ask:**\n\n> \"Sounds like this isn't a burning problem for you right now. Who in the Swiss medtech space DO you think struggles with competitive intelligence or market entry? Can you intro me?\"\n\nUse them as referral sources, not customers.\n\n---\n\n## The Brutal Truth Test\n\nAfter these 2 interviews, answer honestly:\n\n1. **Did they describe a problem that costs them >CHF 15K/year in time or money?** (If no, your pricing is too high or problem isn't acute)\n2. **Are they already paying someone to partially solve this?** (If no, willingness-to-pay is unproven)\n3. **Did they ask YOU follow-up questions about your solution?** (If no, they're just being polite)\n\nIf you can't answer \"yes\" to at least 2 of 3, medtech CI might not be the wedge. You'd need to test MEM or pivot to a different workflow (regulatory monitoring, export market scoring, etc.).\n\n---\n\n## Next Steps (This Week)\n\n1. **Schedule calls with both companies** (target: by Friday)\n2. **Run the discovery interview** (use the questions above, take detailed notes)\n3. **Bring findings to the council meeting:** raw quotes, pain scores, budget reality\n4. **Decide:** Pilot with these 2? Find 3-5 more? Pivot to different sector/workflow?\n\nOnce you've done the interviews, come back and share what you learned. We'll pressure-test whether to proceed with pilots or adjust course.\n\n**Don't build anything yet. Learn first.**",
