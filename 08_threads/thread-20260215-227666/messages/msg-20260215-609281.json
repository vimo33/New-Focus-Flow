  "content": "## ✅ Council Readiness Summary\n\nYour concept is now **council-ready**. Here's what changed:\n\n### Gaps Closed:\n- **Target user specificity**: Quinn (Independent Technophile) is concrete enough for market-fit evaluation — affluent, privacy-focused, tech-native US/UK travelers who value autonomy\n- **Problem validation**: You've cited specific friction points (time perception, interactivity gaps, social isolation, utility failures) that ground the \"passive guides fail\" claim\n- **Competitive positioning**: GetYourGuide, Rick Steves, izi.TRAVEL, and Google Lens are now mapped with clear differentiation (blue ocean between transactional aggregators and passive content)\n- **Business model**: Freemium flywheel with explicit pricing ($14.99 Explorer Pass for tourists, $9.99/mo Premium for locals) addresses sustainability\n- **MVP boundaries**: 3-5 Altstadt landmarks + Zwingli persona + offline City Pack is a testable minimum loop\n- **Risk mitigation**: Content costs (human-in-loop vetting), device fragmentation (529MB/4GB RAM requirements), and hallucination prevention (walled garden knowledge base) are all addressed\n\n### What the Council Will Receive:\nA **comprehensive brief** covering:\n- Validated problem with specific user pain points\n- Defined primary segment with behavioral context\n- Detailed technical architecture (Gemma 3n, LiteRT, SQLite, 1M context orchestration)\n- Clear competitive landscape and strategic positioning\n- Explicit business model with pricing tiers\n- Measurable success criteria (60% completion, 20% D7 retention, 5% conversion)\n- Bounded MVP scope (3-5 landmarks, 1 persona, offline pack)\n- Identified risks with concrete mitigations\n\n### Minor Note for Refinement:\nYou reference \"Kris\" (Local Explorers) in the business model without prior introduction. The council will work with it, but if you want to clarify that persona alongside Quinn before submission, feel free.\n\n---\n\n**You can now hit \"Send to Council\"** — the specialist agents have enough to evaluate feasibility, market fit, UX, business viability, and domain-specific risks. Good work closing the gaps.",
