  "content": "## Council Readiness Audit\n\nHere's how your concept maps to what the council evaluates:\n\n### ✅ **Well-covered:**\n- **Solution Mechanism** — exceptionally detailed. The council's technical feasibility agents will have clear architecture (Gemma 3n, LiteRT, SQLite), performance targets (<500ms latency), and even agent orchestration instructions\n- **Privacy & Security** — strong on-device processing rationale with explicit guardrails (PrivacyEnforcer module, zero external calls during core loop)\n- **Technical Specs** — quantized models, token budgets, TDD requirements are all explicit\n\n### ⚠️ **Needs strengthening:**\n- **Problem validation** — you mention \"passive audio guides\" as the problem, but there's no evidence anyone actually *hates* them or urgently needs an alternative\n- **MVP boundaries** — 4 phases are clear, but what's the *absolute minimum* loop you'd ship to validate the concept? Is it just Grossmünster + Zwingli, or do you need 10 landmarks?\n- **Risk mitigation** — privacy is covered, but what about content creation costs (who writes/vets the historical narratives?), device fragmentation (will this actually run on 2022 Android phones?), or cold-start UX (what if the vision model fails to recognize a landmark)?\n\n### ❌ **Missing/unclear:**\n- **Target user segments** — \"international tourists\" is too broad. Are these budget backpackers? History nerds? Families with kids? The UX/market-fit agents will flag this immediately\n- **Competitive landscape** — zero mention of Rick Steves Audio Europe, Detour, Google Lens + Search, AR tourism apps. What exists today and why does it fail?\n- **Business model** — completely absent. Free? Freemium? Pay-per-city-pack? The council can't evaluate viability without knowing how this sustains itself\n- **Success metrics** — no KPIs. What does \"success\" look like? 10k downloads? 40% week-2 retention? 5-min avg session time?\n\n---\n\n## To get this council-ready, I need to ask about:\n\n**Target user specificity:** You've built an incredibly sophisticated technical system, but *who specifically* is desperate for this experience? \n\nThe feasibility agents will want to know: Are you targeting solo travelers who already use audio guides and find them boring? Couples who want \"Instagram moments\" with historical AR? School groups needing engaging education tools? Each segment has different pain points, willingness-to-pay, and acquisition strategies.\n\n**Tell me:** Who is the *primary* user you're designing for, and what specific behavior or pain point in their current Zurich visit does AURA replace?",
