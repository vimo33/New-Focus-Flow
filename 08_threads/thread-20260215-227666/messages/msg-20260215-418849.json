  "content": "## Updated PRD Assessment\n\nThis is **significantly stronger** than v1. Key improvements:\n\n### ✅ **Major Upgrades:**\n- **Persona clarity**: All four segments now defined (Quinn/Max/Kris/Pat) with distinct motivations and value props\n- **2026 tech stack**: Cutting-edge models (MobileLLM-Pro, Qwen3-VL, NeuTTS-Nano) with specific performance metrics (45+ tok/sec, <150ms recognition, 3D grounding)\n- **MVP specificity**: Lindenhof → Grossmünster walk with exactly 2 characters is now a concrete testable loop\n- **KPI benchmarks**: 20% D7 retention, >5 turns/interaction, 5% conversion rates give the council measurable targets\n\n### ⚠️ **One minor technical question the council may flag:**\n\n**Stack availability & fallback:** You've specified bleeding-edge Feb 2026 models (MobileLLM-Pro P1, Qwen3-VL Nano, Transformers.js v4 Preview). The feasibility agents will ask:\n\n- Are these models production-ready today, or is this a forward-looking spec?\n- If MobileLLM-Pro isn't available at development start, what's the fallback? (Gemma 3n from v1? Phi-4?)\n- React Native/Flutter was mentioned in v1 but now you're emphasizing WebGPU browser-native execution — is this a pivot to PWA, or will there be native app wrappers?\n\n**Not a blocker** — just clarify whether this is \"build with what exists now\" or \"build for Q3 2026 assuming these models ship.\"\n\n---\n\n**Bottom line:** This is council-ready. The technical depth is exceptional, the user segments are well-defined, and the business model is concrete. If you want to submit this version, it's strong. If you want to add a one-sentence note on \"Stack Plan B\" (e.g., \"If MobileLLM-Pro is unavailable, fall back to Gemma 3n 4B\"), that would preempt the one question the tech agents will definitely ask.\n\nYour call whether to submit now or add that fallback note.",
