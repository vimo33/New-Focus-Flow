  "content": "here is an updated PRD Sure, I'll update the PRD with those technical insights and strategic refinements for your council presentation.  Here is the updated Product Requirement Document (PRD) for **AURA**, incorporating the \"Flash-Reasoning\" paradigm and the state-of-the-art models as of February 15, 2026.  ---  # PRD: AURA — The Zurich Discovery Engine (2026 Pilot)  **Status:** Final Draft for AI Council Evaluation  **Version:** 2.0 (Post-Feb 2026 Research Update)  **Lead PM:** AI Strategist Team  **Engineering Team:** Claude Code Opus 4.6 (Orchestrator) + Haiku 4.5 (Sub-agents)  ---  ## 1. Executive Summary & Problem Validation  AURA is an \"Intelligent Companion\" designed to shift urban tourism from passive fact-consumption to active, narrative-driven participation.  ### 1.1 The Problem  Research confirms that traditional tourism tools fail at three critical points:  * **The \"Time Anxiety\" Barrier:** Travelers often avoid audio guides because they assume they require massive, inflexible time investments. * **Social Isolation:** Traditional headsets are perceived as \"antisocial,\" making shared exploration difficult for couples and families. * **Utility Failure:** Official apps (e.g., Zürich City Guide) are frequently criticized for inaccurate map data and clunky UIs.  ### 1.2 The Solution  AURA delivers an on-device, \"Flash-Reasoning\" loop where users point their device at a landmark to trigger instant, interactive historical roleplay. By processing everything locally, AURA guarantees privacy, removes roaming costs, and provides sub-200ms latency.  ---  ## 2. Target User Segments (Refined)  | Persona | Motivation | Behavior Replaced | AURA Value Prop | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | **Quinn (Technophile)** | Autonomy & Privacy | Passive Rick Steves audio / generic Google Lens | On-device, privacy-first reasoning with zero data leakage. | | **Max (Short-Stay)** | Efficiency (FOMO) | Linear, 3-hour walking tours | Time-boxed, curated quests (e.g., \"60-min Reformation\"). | | **Kris (Local)** | Novelty/Discovery | \"I've seen it all\" mindset | Hidden-layer stories unlocked via visual recognition. | | **Pat (Family)** | Edutainment/Bonding | Boring museum plaques | Gamified historical quests for intergenerational play. |  ---  ## 3. The 2026 \"Flash-Reasoning\" Technical Stack  To succeed in 2026, AURA must move beyond static 2025 architectures. The stack is optimized for low-latency WebGPU-enabled inference.  ### 3.1 Core Model Specifications  * **NLU & Reasoning Orchestrator:** `MobileLLM-Pro (P1)`. * **Spec:** 1.08B parameters, distilled from Llama 4-Scout. * **Edge:** 128k context window allows for long \"historical memory\" and 1.8x faster prefill via interleaved attention.   * **Vision & Landmark Grounding:** `Qwen3-VL (Nano)`. * **Edge:** Supports **3D Grounding**. It doesn't just ID a building; it predicts real-world size, depth, and position to anchor AR overlays with centimeter precision.   * **Dynamic Speech Engine:** `NeuTTS-Nano`. * **Edge:** On-device voice cloning (3s sample) and streaming synthesis. No more pre-recorded `.mp3` files; conversations are emergent and unscripted.   * **Quantization Framework:** `SpinQuant`. * **Spec:** 4-bit quantization of weights, activations, and KV-cache together, maintaining <3% accuracy loss.    ### 3.2 Deployment Architecture  * **Execution Framework:** `Transformers.js v4` (Preview). * **Rationale:** Leverages **WebGPU** for browser-native and cross-platform edge inference, ensuring 45+ tokens/sec on mid-range hardware (e.g., 2022+ Android/iPhone).   * **Local Database:** `SQLite`.   * Stores the \"City Pack\" (Landmarks, Character Constitutions, Vetted History).    ---  ## 4. MVP Boundaries: The Zurich POC  The \"Minimum Discovery Loop\" is defined as a walk from **Lindenhof Hill** to **Grossmünster**.  * **Content Scope:** 5 landmarks, 2 historical figures (Gaius the Roman, Huldrych Zwingli). * **The Loop:** 1. **Point:** Qwen3-VL identifies Grossmünster in <150ms. 2. **Discover:** MobileLLM-Pro retrieves vetted narrative nodes from local SQLite. 3. **Converse:** NeuTTS-Nano generates a Latin-accented response from Zwingli regarding his theological revolution.    ---  ## 5. Business & Sustainability Model  AURA utilizes a **Freemium Flywheel** :  * **Aura Free:** Unlimited visual recognition and \"Snapshot\" stories (Zero marginal cost due to on-device AI). * **Explorer Pass ($14.99):** A 72-hour one-time pass for short-stay tourists, avoiding \"subscription fatigue\". * **Aura Premium ($9.99/mo):** Recurring subscription for locals/historians, unlocking cloud-enhanced \"Deep Conversations.\"  ---  ## 6. Risk Mitigation & Guardrails  * **Hallucination Prevention:** A \"Walled Garden\" RAG protocol. The LLM is restricted to rephrasing or navigating expert-vetted data provided by institutional partners (e.g., Swiss National Museum).   * **Content Authenticity:** Non-negotiable pre-launch partnership with an academic institution to validate the \"historical constitution\" of AI characters.   * **Privacy Guardrail:** `PrivacyEnforcer` module logs zero network packets during the core discovery loop, ensuring total data residency.    ---  ## 7. Success Metrics (KPIs)  * **User Retention:** >20% Day-7 retention (benchmark for utility travel apps).   * **Engagement Depth:** Average >5 conversational turns per landmark interaction.   * **Monetization:** >5% free-to-paid conversion (Targeting the Explorer Pass).    ---  **Strategic Recommendation:** Greenlight Phase 1 development immediately using the `Claude Code Opus 4.6` agent team in `tmux` mode to maximize parallel implementation of the WebGPU vision and reasoning engines.",
