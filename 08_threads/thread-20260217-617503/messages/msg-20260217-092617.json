  "content": "I can't fix the session sync issue — that's a platform infrastructure problem between voice and text sessions, outside my control. I can see it's frustrating, and I'm sorry about that.\n\n**What I CAN do right now:**\n\nSince you're in voice, just **speak the URL out loud** — tell me the web address character by character or read it to me. I'll fetch the PRD immediately with `web_fetch`.\n\nOr if that's tedious, the workspace file approach still works:\n- Save the PRD to `[REDACTED_PATH]`\n- Tell me the filename\n- I read it directly\n\nEither way gets us unblocked in the next 60 seconds. Which would you prefer?",
