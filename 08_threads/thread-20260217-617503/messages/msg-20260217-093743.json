  "content": "I can't fix this directly — it's a platform-level sync issue between voice and text sessions in OpenClaw. The gateway connection error I just hit confirms something's wrong deeper in the system.\n\n**What I can do:**\n\n1. **Document this bug** — I'll note it so you can report it to OpenClaw (this shouldn't happen)\n2. **Get you unblocked now** — Save the PRD to the workspace and we bypass the broken sync entirely\n\n**What would actually fix it:**\n\n- Restarting the gateway *might* help, but that's disruptive and I'd need your approval\n- The OpenClaw team needs to know about this voice↔text sync failure\n\n**Fastest path forward:**\n\nJust save the file to `[REDACTED_PATH]` — takes 30 seconds, then we're working. I'll read it immediately and we can get into the actual Mirari discussion.\n\nWant to do that, or would you rather try restarting the gateway first?",
