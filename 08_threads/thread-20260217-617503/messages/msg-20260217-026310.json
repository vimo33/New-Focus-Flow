  "content": "Let me check the full session history to see if your messages are there but just not showing up in my view.\n\nThere's a technical issue — I can't access the full session history right now (gateway connection error). That explains why I'm not seeing your messages even though you can see them.\n\n**The most reliable fix:**\n\nSave the PRD directly to the workspace:\n\n1. Open your file manager\n2. Navigate to: `[REDACTED_PATH]`\n3. Save the PRD there (any name: `mirari-prd.md`, `prd.txt`, whatever)\n4. Tell me the filename\n\nThat bypasses the chat completely — I'll read it straight from disk. Should take 30 seconds and we'll be unblocked.\n\nWant to try that?",
