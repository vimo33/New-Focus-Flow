  "content": "Let me check what documentation we have for Mirari.\n\nNo — I don't have the full PRD. All I have is the project summary in the world state:\n\n> \"Zero-UI temporal companion overlaying history onto physical Zurich. Full-duplex multimodal AI using MiniCPM-o 4.5, Qwen3-VL spatial grounding, and generative world engine for unscripted historical roleplay. Voice-first, proactive landmark identification, 4-layer spatial audio, on-device privacy. Version 5.0 - Post-Freedom Design.\"\n\nThe mention of \"Version 5.0\" suggests there's a document somewhere, but it's not in the workspace. Do you have it elsewhere, or should we pull it into the workspace so I can work with it?",
