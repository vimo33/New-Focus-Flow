That's beyond my control.\n\n**What I CAN do:**\n\nHelp you work around it. The fastest path right now:\n\n1. **Save the PRD to the workspace** → I read it directly from disk\n   - Path: `[REDACTED_PATH]\n   - Takes 30 seconds, bypasses the chat entirely\n\n2. **Type the URL here manually** → Break it into parts if needed, I'll reassemble it\n\n3. **Describe the PRD verbally** in voice → I'll take structured notes\n\nPick whichever is least annoying. Once I have the content, we can move forward.\n\nThe sync bug is frustrating — I get it. But we can route around it. Which option works for you?",
