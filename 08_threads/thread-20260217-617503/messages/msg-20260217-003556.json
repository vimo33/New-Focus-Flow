  "content": "Right — you're in voice mode, but there should be a text input field somewhere in the interface where you can type or paste while we're talking.\n\n**Try this:**\n\n1. Look for a text box in the voice chat UI (usually at the bottom)\n2. Paste the URL there and hit send\n3. I should receive it as a regular message\n\nIf that works, I'll grab the PRD from the URL immediately.\n\nIf you still don't see a text input, just save the file to `[REDACTED_PATH]` and tell me the filename — I'll read it from there.",
