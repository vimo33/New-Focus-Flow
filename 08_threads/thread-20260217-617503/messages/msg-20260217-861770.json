  "content": "Sounds like there's a technical issue with the chat. If pasting isn't working, let's try this instead:\n\n**Save it to the workspace:**\n\n1. Save the PRD as a file on your machine (e.g., `mirari-prd.md` or `mirari-prd.txt`)\n2. Copy it to: `[REDACTED_PATH]`\n3. Tell me the filename\n\nThen I can read it directly. That'll bypass whatever's blocking the paste.\n\nAlternatively — is it hosted anywhere online (Google Docs, GitHub, Notion)? I can fetch it from a URL with `web_fetch`.",
