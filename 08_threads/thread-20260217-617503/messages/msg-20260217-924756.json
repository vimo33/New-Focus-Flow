This is definitely a connection issue on the chat's end — whatever you're sending isn't reaching me.\n\n**Let's work around it:**\n\nCan you **type the URL out character by character** or break it into pieces? Sometimes that helps bypass chat glitches.\n\nOr if that's annoying:\n\n- Save the PRD to `[REDACTED_PATH]` (any filename is fine)\n- Tell me the filename\n- I'll read it directly\n\nYour call — either way works. Sorry about the technical friction here.",
