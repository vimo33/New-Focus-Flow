  "content": "I can't fix the chat infrastructure itself — that's outside my control. But **switching to voice might be a good workaround**:\n\nIf you're in voice mode, you could just **tell me the URL out loud** or **describe the key parts of the PRD**, and I'll capture it.\n\nOr if the PRD is long, you could:\n- Read me the URL in voice → I fetch it with `web_fetch`\n- Summarize the PRD verbally → I take notes and we work from that\n\nWant to try voice? Just hit the mic button and tell me the URL or walk me through the PRD's main points.",
