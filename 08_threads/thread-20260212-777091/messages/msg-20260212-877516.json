The council will see our full conversation, so my questions will help them understand what you've refined and what trade-offs you've considered.\n\n**Before we dive into gaps, tell me: what specific aspect are you most uncertain about?** What part do you think the council might still push back on, or where do you want their strongest validation?\n\n(This will help me know where to focus our prep conversation.)",
