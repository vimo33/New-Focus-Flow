  "content": "Great pivot—both paths are viable, but they require very different business models and skill sets.\n\n**Quick take:**\n\n**Consulting (Swiss focus):**\n- Switzerland has high willingness to pay for privacy-focused, self-hosted solutions\n- Strong data sovereignty culture (GDPR+, banking secrecy heritage)\n- SMBs often struggle with fragmented SaaS tools\n- You'd be selling implementation + customization, not the software itself\n\n**Open-source monetization:**\n- Dual licensing (AGPL free, commercial license paid)\n- Managed hosting (you run it for them)\n- Enterprise support/training packages\n- Premium modules (like Flowise integration, advanced AI Council)\n- Consulting tier (implementation services)\n\n**Before I go deeper:** What's your primary goal here—**building a consulting practice** (recurring client relationships, customization work), or **building a product** (scale through software, community-driven growth)?\n\nThe answer changes everything about positioning, pricing, and where you spend your energy.",
