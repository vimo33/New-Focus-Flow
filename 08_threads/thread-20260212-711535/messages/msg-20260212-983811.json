Consulting is the faster path to revenue and lets you validate the concept with real users before deciding what (if anything) to productize later.\n\n## The Swiss Consulting Play\n\n### **Why This Works in Switzerland**\n\n1. **Data sovereignty paranoia** (in a good way) — Swiss clients *hate* SaaS that stores data abroad\n2. **High willingness to pay** — Labor rates are 2-3x EU average\n3. **SMB fragmentation** — Most businesses use 10+ disconnected tools (CRM, PM, Slack, email, etc.)\n4. **AI adoption gap** — They want AI benefits but don't trust ChatGPT/cloud providers\n5. **German-speaking precision culture** — They love structured systems like Focus Flow\n\n### **Service Packages (3-Tier Model)**\n\n#### **Tier 1: Personal Knowledge OS** (CHF 3,500–5,000)\n*Target: Consultants, lawyers, doctors, executives*\n\n- Hetzner VPS setup (€20/mo recurring)\n- Tailscale + Telegram integration\n- Obsidian vault as PKM\n- OpenClaw with basic agents (email, calendar, todo)\n- 2 training sessions (2h each)\n\n**Positioning:** \"Your personal AI assistant that runs on *your* infrastructure\"\n\n---\n\n#### **Tier 2: Team Productivity Hub** (CHF 12,000–18,000)\n*Target: 5–20 person SMBs (agencies, law firms, clinics)*\n\n- Everything in Tier 1\n- Multi-user dashboard (n8n/Coolify hosted)\n- Shared project vault (team Obsidian sync)\n- Custom AI workflows (client intake, proposal gen, etc.)\n- Slack/Teams integration (replace some Telegram)\n- Monthly maintenance (CHF 500–800/mo)\n\n**Positioning:** \"Replace 6 SaaS subscriptions with one self-hosted system\"\n\n---\n\n#### **Tier 3: Full AI-Powered Ops** (CHF 25,000–50,000)\n*Target: 20–100 person companies*\n\n- Everything in Tier 2\n- AI Council for project validation\n- Auto-Claude for internal tool building\n- Flowise integration (custom LLM chains)\n- API integrations (ERP, CRM, etc.)\n- Quarterly strategy reviews\n\n**Positioning:** \"Your company's AI operations layer\"\n\n---\n\n### **Revenue Model**\n\n| Revenue Stream | Year 1 Target | Notes |\n|---|---|---|\n| Setup fees | CHF 60K (10 Tier 1 clients) | One-time, 3–5K each |\n| Monthly retainers | CHF 6K/mo (12 clients @ 500/mo) | Maintenance + support |\n| Hosting markups | CHF 1.2K/mo (20% margin on infra) | VPS, storage, bandwidth |\n| Training workshops | CHF 8K (4 workshops/year) | Group training for SMBs |\n| **Total Year 1** | **~CHF 140K** | Part-time viable |\n\n---\n\n### **What to Open-Source vs. Keep Proprietary**\n\n**Open-source (build credibility):**\n- Core architecture docs (like this PRD)\n- Obsidian templates + workflows\n- Basic OpenClaw agent configs\n- Setup scripts (Ansible/Docker Compose)\n\n**Keep proprietary (your consulting edge):**\n- Client-specific customizations\n- Industry templates (legal, medical, etc.)\n- Advanced Flowise chains\n- Your implementation methodology\n\n**License:** MIT or Apache 2.0 (permissive) — you want companies to feel safe using it, not fearing AGPL contagion.\n\n---\n\n### **Go-to-Market: First 5 Clients**\n\n#### **Phase 1: Warm network (Month 1–2)**\n- Post on LinkedIn (in German): \"Ich helfe Schweizer Unternehmen, ihre eigene AI-Infrastruktur aufzubauen\"\n- Target: People who've complained about SaaS costs or data privacy\n- Offer: 1 free \"AI Readiness Audit\" (2h consultation)\n\n#### **Phase 2: Local tech communities (Month 2–4)**\n- SwissMADE Software meetups\n- Digital Switzerland forums\n- Zürich/Bern/Geneva startup events\n- Give a talk: \"Why Swiss SMBs Should Self-Host Their AI\"\n\n#### **Phase 3: Case study marketing (Month 3–6)**\n- Document first client's ROI (time saved, SaaS costs eliminated)\n- Publish as blog post + LinkedIn article\n- Pitch to Swiss tech media (inside-it.ch, netzwoche.ch)\n\n---\n\n### **Positioning One-Liner**\n\n**English:** \"I help Swiss businesses build their own AI operations layer—privately hosted, fully customizable, no vendor lock-in.\"\n\n**German (your primary market):** \"Ich helfe Schweizer Unternehmen, ihre eigene AI-Infrastruktur aufzubauen—selbst gehostet, datenschutzkonform, keine Abhängigkeiten.\"\n\n---\n\n### **Next Steps (What to Build First)**\n\n1. **Polish the core stack** (Obsidian + OpenClaw + Telegram + Dashboard) — this is your demo\n2. **Create a 1-page \"AI Audit\" template** — what you'll use in sales calls\n3. **Build 3 industry templates** (pick: legal, medical, or consulting—whichever you have connections in)\n4. **Set up your own site** (Coolify-hosted, dogfood your own stack)\n5. **Find your first paying client** — even if it's just Tier 1 for CHF 3K\n\n---\n\n**Your biggest leverage:** Switzerland is *desperate* for privacy-respecting AI solutions, and most consultants are either (a) selling cloud SaaS or (b) too technical to sell to business owners. You're positioned perfectly in the middle.\n\nWant me to help you draft the \"AI Readiness Audit\" template, or map out the first client onboarding workflow?",
