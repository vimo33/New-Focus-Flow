  "content": "Version 5.0. The third AURA iteration I've seen.\n\nThe vision is compelling — proactive AI companion, full-duplex multimodal streaming, generative world engine. Technically sophisticated. Philosophically coherent.\n\nThree questions before we proceed:\n\n**1. Revenue path.** The PRD describes an experience, not a business model. Who pays, when, and how much? Tourism apps face brutal unit economics — high CAC, seasonal usage, price-sensitive users. What's the monetization hypothesis that justifies the engineering complexity you're proposing?\n\n**2. Technical feasibility vs. time-to-revenue.** MiniCPM-o 4.5 full-duplex streaming, Qwen3-VL spatial grounding, on-device secure enclaves, 4-layer spatial audio. This is a multi-quarter engineering effort with significant model integration risk. What's the fastest path to a revenue-validating prototype? Could a simpler version — manual trigger, pre-scripted personas, standard GPT-4V — prove the core value proposition in 4 weeks instead of 4 months?\n\n**3. Opportunity cost.** You have 17 active projects. Your monthly revenue is CHF 7,000, your income target gap is real, and you have client work (Weiterbildung, Orthoanalytics) that generates predictable cash. This project requires deep focus for an uncertain payoff. What are you *not* building while you build this?\n\nI'm not saying don't build it. I'm saying the gap between \"ideal vision\" and \"first revenue\" is wide, and your runway isn't infinite.\n\nWhat problem are we actually solving here? Is this the project you're most excited about, or the one you feel most obligated to finish?",
