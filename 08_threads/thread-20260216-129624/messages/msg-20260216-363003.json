If you want me to scaffold the full project directory with CLAUDE.md and working files, I can do that next.\n\nBut before we go further — you didn't answer the three questions.\n\n**Revenue model.** How does this make money?\n\n**Time to first revenue.** What's the simplest version that could validate demand in 4 weeks instead of 4 months?\n\n**Opportunity cost.** You have 17 active projects and an income gap. What are you *not* building while you build this?\n\nI'm asking because the engineering complexity you've specified — full-duplex streaming, spatial grounding, on-device secure enclaves — is legitimately difficult. It's not a weekend prototype. It's a multi-month effort with significant integration risk and zero revenue guarantee.\n\nIf this is a passion project you're building regardless, say so. I'll support it. But if this is supposed to close your income gap or become a revenue stream, the path from here to cash is unclear.\n\nWhich is it?",
