  "content": "The Council came back with a 5 out of 10 — needs info, not a rejection, but the feedback is pointed.\n\nFeasibility scored lowest at 4. The core problem: two model names in the PRD — NeuTTS-Nano and MobileLLM-Pro P1 — are not real, verifiable models. That's a credibility killer that contaminates every other technical claim. And the Secure Enclave characterization is wrong — those don't run LLM inference.\n\nMarket scored a 6, which is the bright spot. Zurich is a smart beachhead, cultural tourism is real and large. But the Council flagged the Detour precedent hard — Airbnb acquired that exact product for this exact thesis, then shut it down. And your Day-30 retention target of 25% is structurally impossible for a tourist-first product. Tourists don't return to Zurich within 30 days.\n\nUX scored a 5. The cruelest irony the Council identified: Zero-UI requires the most onboarding of any interface paradigm. And the proactive whisper model — your strongest differentiator — is also your highest churn risk. One poorly-timed whisper on Bahnhofstrasse and the app gets uninstalled. Zurich compounds this. It's a quiet city. Sustained voice conversations on street corners conflict with local social norms, and the PRD doesn't acknowledge that at all.\n\nThe synthesis: this is a 2029 product being spec'd as a 2026 product. The vision is genuinely differentiated. The Digital Souvenirs mechanic, the 4-layer spatial audio — that's real design depth. But the immediate work is: replace the fictional model names, decide whether this is a phone app or AR glasses, and define a monetization model. The PRD is at v5 and still has no revenue mechanism.\n\nWhere do you want to dig in first?",
