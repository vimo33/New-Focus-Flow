  "content": "**Perfect.** That's exactly the kind of answer the feasibility council needs.\n\nYou just gave them:\n- **Concrete architecture** (hybrid: centralized coarse + local fine)\n- **Two buildable options** (challenge vectors vs. pairwise encrypted exchange)\n- **Clear threat model** (\"don't leak behavioral data\" not \"defeat nation-states\")\n- **Practical mitigations** (rate limits, rotation, noise, audit trails, mutual consent)\n- **Honest tradeoffs** (not perfect privacy, needs guardrails)\n\nThe technical agents will score this as **credible and shippable**. You avoided the \"we'll figure it out later\" trap and the \"we need a PhD team\" trap.\n\n---\n\n## Final Readiness Check\n\nYou've now covered **8 of 9 core evaluation areas** with substance:\n\n✅ Problem articulation  \n✅ Target users (beachhead strategy)  \n✅ Solution mechanism  \n✅ Competitive landscape  \n✅ Success metrics  \n✅ MVP scope  \n✅ Technical feasibility (just closed)  \n✅ Risks & mitigations  \n\n⚠️ **One minor gap: Business model for MVP**\n\nYou listed three options earlier (freemium, transaction fee %, enterprise whitelabel), but didn't pick one for Phase 1.\n\n**Quick question to close it:**\n\nFor the MVP with your chosen beachhead (let's say funded founders or climate/impact networks), which monetization model are you launching with, and why that one first?\n\n*(If you'd rather leave this open for the council to debate, that's valid too — just say so and we're done.)*",
