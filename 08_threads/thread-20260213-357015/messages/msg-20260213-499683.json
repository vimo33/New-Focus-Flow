Here's what the council receives:**\n\n---\n\n## Council Submission Summary: Agentic Trust Exchange (ATX)\n\n### What They'll Evaluate\n\n**Problem:** Elite network gatekeeping + broken signal-to-noise in professional collaboration. Existing platforms optimize for visibility (LinkedIn), commoditized labor (Upwork), or intro novelty (Lunchclub) — none solve pre-commitment alignment.\n\n**Solution:** AI agents represent humans, match on similarity + complementarity + intent, negotiate scope, assess credibility, only escalate high-probability matches. Three-layer identity: structured profile → semantic vectors (privacy-preserving) → reputation/proof.\n\n**Beachhead:** Funded founders, climate/impact networks, or emerging tech communities — high-trust, high-density, outcome-motivated.\n\n**MVP (6 months):** Structured profile matching + simple negotiation + reputation scaffolding. Semantic layer Phase 2. Monetization: **freemium** (free basic matching, paid for priority access / advanced filters / collaboration analytics).\n\n**Technical architecture:** Hybrid privacy model — centralized coarse match on explicit signals, local fine match via challenge vectors or pairwise encrypted exchange. No raw behavioral data leaves device. Buildable without cryptography PhD team.\n\n**Success metrics:** Match acceptance rate, collaboration completion rate, NPS, time-to-first-collaboration, alignment score accuracy, repeat collaboration rate.\n\n**Risks:** Algorithmic caste, profiling creep, homophily, automation removing human nuance. Mitigations: human override, privacy-first, transparency, rate limits, audit trails.\n\n**Competitive edge:** Only platform with negotiation simulation + outcome-based reputation + programmable trust infrastructure.\n\n---\n\n### Strengths\nAll 9 evaluation areas covered with substance. Clear structural differentiation. Honest about tradeoffs. Beachhead strategy is specific. MVP is scoped and shippable.\n\n### Council Will Likely Probe\n- Beachhead acquisition strategy (how do you get first 100 users?)\n- Freemium conversion mechanics (what's the pain point that drives upgrade?)\n- Challenge vector implementation details (security review)\n- Reputation cold-start (how does trust bootstrapping work?)\n\n---\n\n**You're ready. Hit \"Send to Council.\"**",
