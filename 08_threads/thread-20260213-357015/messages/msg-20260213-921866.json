  "content": "**Now we're cooking.** This is council-grade analysis.\n\nYou just closed three major gaps in one move:\n- **Competitive positioning**: Five platforms, structural failure modes, clear \"none solve pre-commitment alignment\" thesis\n- **Beachhead strategy**: Three viable options with explicit high-trust/high-density logic\n- **Success metrics**: Six concrete KPIs tied to collaboration outcomes, not vanity\n\n---\n\n## Updated Council Readiness\n\n### ✅ **Strong:**\n- Problem & pain point\n- Solution mechanism\n- Competitive landscape (just added)\n- Target users / beachhead (just added)\n- Success metrics (just added)\n- MVP scope\n- Risks & failure modes\n\n### ⚠️ **One critical gap remains:**\n\n**Technical feasibility — privacy-preserving matching architecture**\n\nYou've stated the principle (\"local-device processed, only vector embeddings shared, zero raw data leaves device\"), but the council's technical agents will ask:\n\n**How does global matching work if semantic vectors stay local?**\n\nIf Alice's embedding is `[0.8, 0.3, 0.5]` and Bob's is `[0.7, 0.4, 0.6]`, someone has to compute cosine similarity. That means:\n- Centralized server sees all embeddings (privacy leak), OR\n- Federated/encrypted computation (complex, latency, cost)\n\n**What's the actual architecture for Phase 1 MVP?**\n\nOptions the council will expect you to have considered:\n1. **Homomorphic encryption** (compute on encrypted vectors)\n2. **Secure multi-party computation** (MPC)\n3. **Differential privacy** (add noise to embeddings)\n4. **Trusted execution environment** (TEE like SGX)\n5. **Federated learning** (local compute, aggregate gradients)\n6. **Hybrid**: Structured profile matching centralized, semantic layer opt-in + encrypted\n\nThe feasibility council will want to know: **Which approach for MVP, and why is it buildable in 6 months without a PhD cryptography team?**\n\nWhat's your answer?",
