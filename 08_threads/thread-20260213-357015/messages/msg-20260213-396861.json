  "content": "## Council Readiness Audit\n\nHere's how your concept maps to what the council evaluates:\n\n### ✅ **Well-covered:**\n\n- **Problem articulation** — Elite network gatekeeping, signal-to-noise economics, missing programmable trust layer (concrete and urgent)\n- **Solution mechanism** — Three-layer identity architecture, matching engine logic (similarity/complementarity/intent), negotiation simulation, escalation threshold\n- **MVP phasing** — Clear v1/Phase 2/Phase 3 boundaries; starts simple (structured profile) before adding complexity (semantic vectors)\n- **Risks & mitigations** — Four major risks named (algorithmic caste, profiling creep, homophily, automation removing nuance) with mitigation principle stated (human override + privacy-first)\n\n### ⚠️ **Needs strengthening:**\n\n- **Target users** — Examples given (Brad Pitt's agent, Swiss medtech founder) but no definition of *initial beachhead segment*. Who are the first 100 users?\n- **Success metrics** — Mentions alignment score thresholds but no *platform* success KPIs (quality of match, collaboration completion rate, NPS, time-to-value)\n- **Technical feasibility** — Architecture components named but no specifics on privacy-preserving matching implementation (homomorphic encryption? federated learning? private set intersection?)\n- **Business model** — Three options listed but no recommendation or unit economics. Which model for MVP? What's the price point or fee structure?\n\n### ❌ **Missing/unclear:**\n\n- **Competitive landscape** — Says \"not LinkedIn, not Upwork\" but doesn't analyze existing professional matching platforms, AI networking tools, or agent-mediated collaboration attempts. What has failed? What's different here beyond philosophical framing?\n\n---\n\n## To Get This Council-Ready\n\nThe feasibility agents will score **competitive positioning** heavily — right now you have philosophical differentiation (\"programmable trust infrastructure\") but no analysis of alternatives or prior attempts.\n\n**My first question:**\n\nWhat professional networking or AI-powered matching platforms have you looked at, and where specifically do they fail that ATX succeeds? The council will want to know: has this been tried? Why did it not work? What's the structural advantage here beyond \"agents are cheaper than humans\"?\n\n(Naming 3–5 competitors with specific failure modes will make the differentiation concrete rather than aspirational.)",
