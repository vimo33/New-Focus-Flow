  "content": "Perfect — that's critical context. Using **AI-native tooling** (Claude Code, Opus 4.6 multi-agent, ComfyUI for image generation) changes the feasibility equation significantly.\n\nNow I have what I need. Let me compile the concept for council review:\n\n---\n\n## **Concept Summary: Personalized Swiss Jass Card Platform**\n\n**Problem:**  \nGeneric personalized playing cards lack emotional depth and cultural authenticity. Swiss Jass players have limited options for custom decks that honor tradition while celebrating personal connections.\n\n**Solution:**  \nA platform to create custom Swiss Jass decks where users upload photos of friends/family and AI transforms them into styled card characters. Cultural authenticity meets personalization.\n\n**Target Users (all three via A/B testing):**\n1. Gift-givers seeking unique presents for occasions (birthdays, weddings, holidays)\n2. Game enthusiasts wanting quality custom decks for regular play\n3. Swiss expats/heritage communities wanting culturally authentic Jass with personal twist\n\n**Differentiation:**\n- Emotional resonance (your people as the characters)\n- Cultural authenticity (proper Jass suits, Swiss aesthetic)\n- AI-powered design wizard (easy for non-designers)\n\n**V1 Scope (full-featured from launch):**\n- Simple photo upload → AI character generation\n- Design customization tools\n- Cultural accuracy (authentic Jass iconography)\n- Premium print quality for replayability\n\n**Technical Approach:**\n- Claude Code + Opus 4.6 multi-agent harness (AI-driven development)\n- Weavy (collaboration/UI flow)\n- ComfyUI (image generation pipeline)\n\n**Timeline:** 6 months to MVP  \n**Investment:** $50k\n\n---\n\n**The concept is ready for council review.** They'll evaluate technical feasibility, market risks, architecture, and ROI. Want me to convene the council now?",
