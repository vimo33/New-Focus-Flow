  "content": "# Swiss Jass AI card deck generator: platforms, prompts, and production pipeline\n\n**FLUX Kontext on ComfyUI is the strongest production path for generating 36 consistent Swiss Jass cards**, with Weavy.ai (now Figma Weave) as a compelling prototyping alternative and OpenArt.ai as the fastest manual testing ground. The three complete prompt template sets below — Fun Cartoon, Escher Geometric, and Dark Fantasy — each use a modular architecture that separates style (constant) from content (variable), enabling batch generation across all 36 cards while preserving visual cohesion. The key insight from community card projects: **generate art illustrations separately, then composite onto card templates** — never try to generate a complete card in one shot.\n\n---\n\n## Platform comparison: Weavy.ai, ComfyUI, and OpenArt.ai\n\n### Weavy.ai (now Figma Weave)\n\nWeavy.ai is a **browser-based, node-based AI creative workflow platform** founded in Tel Aviv in 2024 and acquired by Figma in October 2025 for $200+ million. It chains multiple AI models (image, video, 3D, text/LLM) with professional editing tools on an infinite canvas.\n\nFor Swiss Jass card generation, Weavy's standout feature is its **Iterator Nodes**: a Text Iterator combined with an Array Node can send all 36 card prompts to a generative model simultaneously, with cloud servers spinning up in parallel. It supports **FLUX Fast, Dev (with LoRA), Kontext, and Pro Ultra**, plus Ideogram V3, GPT Image 1, Stable Diffusion 3.5, Imagen 4, and dozens more. Custom LoRAs can be imported from CivitAI, Hugging Face, and Replicate. Compositing tools (layers, masking, color grading, relighting) are built into the node graph, enabling post-processing as part of the pipeline.\n\n**Pricing** ranges from free (150 credits/month, enough for ~375 Flux Fast images) to Professional at $45/month (4,000 credits). A full 36-card batch using Flux Dev with LoRA costs approximately **144 credits** — well within the Starter plan. Commercial rights are included.\n\n**Key limitation**: Weavy exposes fewer granular parameters than ComfyUI. You cannot fine-tune ControlNet scheduling or sampler configurations. The API for programmatic automation is \"coming soon\" on the Enterprise tier, meaning current workflows require browser interaction. For prototyping and visual pipeline design, Weavy is excellent. For production automation of hundreds of decks, **ComfyUI remains superior**.\n\n### ComfyUI: the production powerhouse\n\nComfyUI offers the deepest control for card generation through its open-source node ecosystem. Several community workflows already exist for card generation:\n\n- **ArtisMysterium's 6-Lane Playing Card Workflow** (Civitai, 465+ downloads): Generates card elements separately across six parallel lanes — background, title, cost symbol, main illustration, description, and borders — then composites them. Uses LayerDiffuse for transparency and SDXL checkpoints. This composite approach is **far more controllable** than single-shot generation.\n- **matt3o's Trading Card Game Maker** (OpenArt): Complex compositing template using IP-Adapter for style reference and 14 preview nodes for QA.\n- **NEAR Monsters NFT Card Game**: A full production pipeline using SDXL + ComfyUI, automated via Python scripts that intercepted API calls. Used a custom ImageCurator webapp for accept/reject workflows and GPT-V for card naming.\n\n**FLUX Kontext integration** is the most promising technology for card-to-card consistency. The 12B-parameter model supports character consistency from a single reference, style transfer, and iterative editing with minimal drift. ComfyUI loads Kontext natively via `flux1-dev-kontext_fp8_scaled.safetensors`, with multi-image input through Image Stitch nodes or chained ReferenceLatent nodes. Minimum 12GB VRAM (GGUF quantized), 24GB+ recommended.\n\nFor **face preservation on court cards**, the recommended stack is **PuLID for FLUX** (`ComfyUI-PuLID-Flux`), which achieves zero \"model pollution\" — preserving artistic style while swapping faces. The combined **Flux Kontext + PuLID workflow** provides the best modern approach: Kontext handles style/context, PuLID handles identity. InstantID remains an option for SDXL-only workflows but is in maintenance mode.\n\n**Batch automation** is solved through multiple approaches: the ComfyUI Inspire Pack's `LoadPromptsFromFile` node reads prompt files with positive/negative sections; `comfy-batcher` queues thousands of prompts via the REST API; and the native API endpoint (`/prompt`) accepts JSON workflow submissions monitored via WebSocket. A Python script iterating through 36 card definitions in CSV/JSON, modifying prompt text and input images per card, is the recommended production approach.\n\n### OpenArt.ai: fastest manual testing\n\nOpenArt aggregates **100+ models** including FLUX Kontext Pro, FLUX Dev, GPT Image 1, Imagen 4, Gemini, and SDXL variants under one interface. It has **dedicated playing card and tarot card generators** with example prompts, making it the fastest way to test prompt templates before automating.\n\nThe platform's **Image Guidance system** supports five reference types simultaneously: Style, Composition, Face, Pose, and General references. For card testing, Style Reference + Composition Reference is the most useful pairing. FLUX Dev provides the most controls (CFG slider, steps, seed, upscale options). The **Characters Beta** feature trains a consistent character from 1-4+ photos in ~10 minutes for **1,000 credits**, directly enabling court card face consistency.\n\n**Batch generation** via CSV (up to 500 images at once) is available on Advanced plans ($14.50/month), though OpenArt has announced reworking this feature. The free tier is limited to 512×512 without image guidance — the Essential plan ($7/month) is the minimum for card art testing with references.\n\n---\n\n## The modular prompt template architecture\n\nAll three style sets below use a **four-layer modular system** that cleanly separates concerns:\n\n```\nFINAL_PROMPT = {STYLE_LAYER} + {COMPOSITION_LAYER} + {CONTENT_LAYER} + {QUALITY_LAYER}\n```\n\n**Layer 1 — Style Layer** remains constant across all 36 cards within a style. It defines the artistic medium, color philosophy, rendering technique, and mood. This is the \"style bible\" enforced on every generation.\n\n**Layer 2 — Composition Layer** varies by card type (court, pip, ace) but stays consistent within each type across all four suits. It defines layout, framing, and spatial relationships.\n\n**Layer 3 — Content Layer** is unique per card. It specifies the subject, suit-specific elements, and rank-specific details. This is the only layer that changes for every single card.\n\n**Layer 4 — Quality Layer** remains constant. It specifies resolution, rendering quality, and critical exclusions.\n\nFor FLUX models, prompts should use **natural language paragraphs** rather than comma-separated keywords. FLUX pays more attention to words at the beginning of prompts. For SDXL, comma-separated keywords with emphasis brackets work best.\n\n```python\n# Production template system (Python pseudocode)\ndef generate_prompt(style: str, suit: str, rank: str) -> str:\n    style_layer = STYLES[style][\"global\"]\n    composition = COMPOSITIONS[get_card_type(rank)]\n    content = CONTENT[rank].format(\n        suit_symbol=SUITS[style][suit][\"symbol\"],\n        suit_colors=SUITS[style][suit][\"colors\"],\n        character=CHARACTERS[style][suit].get(rank, \"\")\n    )\n    quality = QUALITY_LAYERS[style]\n    return f\"{style_layer}, {composition}, {content}, {quality}\"\n```\n\n---\n\n## Style A — Fun/Whimsical Cartoon: complete template set\n\n### Global style reference (constant across all 36 cards)\n\n```\nSTYLE_A_GLOBAL = \"Whimsical cartoon illustration in ligne claire style with bold clean \noutlines, flat vibrant color areas, smooth cel-shading, playful European comic book \naesthetic inspired by Studio Ghibli warmth and Franco-Belgian bande dessinée precision, \ncheerful storybook illustration for a playing card, hand-drawn feel with digital \npolish, warm soft lighting\"\n```\n\n### Suit-specific color palettes and motifs\n\n| Suit | Primary Colors | Motif Keywords | Symbol Description |\n|------|---------------|----------------|-------------------|\n| **Schellen (Bells)** | Warm golden yellow, orange-amber, cherry red | Festive, musical, jingling, carnival | `a cheerful round golden sleigh bell with a smiling face, warm amber glow` |\n| **Schilten (Shields)** | Royal blue, silver-white, sky blue | Noble, protective, heraldic, steadfast | `a round cartoon heraldic shield with a friendly crest design, polished silver-blue` |\n| **Eicheln (Acorns)** | Forest green, warm brown, amber | Woodland, cozy, autumn, natural | `a plump friendly acorn with a cute cap, nestled among oak leaves, earthy brown-green` |\n| **Rosen (Roses)** | Bright pink-red, soft green, coral | Romantic, blooming, garden, elegant | `a cheerful blooming cartoon rose with soft petals and curling leaves, pink-red` |\n\n### Court card templates (König, Ober, Under)\n\n**König (King) — all suits:**\n```\n{STYLE_A_GLOBAL}, full portrait of a charming cartoon king character wearing an \noversized golden crown, {suit_colors} royal robes with {suit_symbol} embroidery, \nholding a {suit_symbol} scepter, large expressive

realistic skin texture, film grain, noise, muddy colors, desaturated, \ngothic, scary, violent, blood\n```\n\n### Consistency enforcement for Style A\n\n- **LoRA approach**: Train on 30-40 images of ligne claire / Franco-Belgian comic illustrations. CivitAI has existing \"cartoon style\" LoRAs to start from.\n- **Midjourney `--sref`**: Generate one perfect König of Bells first, then use its URL as `--sref` for all 35 remaining cards.\n- **FLUX Kontext**: Generate the hero card, then prompt: *\"Maintain the exact same cartoon illustration style, linework weight, and color saturation, but change the subject to [X]\"*\n- **Fixed elements**: Every card shares the same border pattern, the same outline weight, and the same background tone.\n\n---\n\n## Style B — Escher-Inspired Geometric: complete template set\n\n### Global style reference\n\n```\nSTYLE_B_GLOBAL = \"MC Escher inspired geometric illustration, lithographic woodcut \nengraving style, impossible geometry and tessellation patterns, mathematical \nprecision with

text, \nwatermark, cluttered, busy, scattered elements, gaps in pattern\n```\n\n### Consistency enforcement for Style B\n\n- **ControlNet is critical**: Create geometric guide images (depth maps with the tessellation grid) and use ControlNet to maintain mathematical precision across all 36 cards.\n- **Limited palette enforcement**: Define exact hex values per suit and match across all cards in post-processing.\n- **Geometric vocabulary**: Define 3-4 base geometric motifs per suit and reuse them identically.\n- AI struggles with true mathematical tessellations. Expect **significant post-processing** or use ControlNet with pre-designed geometric templates. Style B is the hardest of the three to execute purely through prompting.\n\n---\n\n## Style C — Game of Thrones / Dark Fantasy: complete template set\n\n### Global style

modern, sci-fi, neon, robotic, pixelated, low quality, blurry, \nextra fingers, bad anatomy, watermark, text, signature, oversaturated, washed-out, \nsmooth plastic texture, stock photo, generic, happy, cheerful expressions\n```\n\n### Consistency enforcement for Style C\n\n- **\"DVD screengrab\" prefix technique**: Adding `\"DVD screengrab from dark fantasy film\"` to every prompt locks in a consistent cinematic aesthetic with appropriate film grain and period lighting.\n- **Fixed artist anchors**: Use the same 2-3 artist references (Greg Rutkowski, Craig Mullins, concept art) across every card.\n- **Per-suit lighting protocol**: Bells always use torchlight. Shields always use cold moonlight. Acorns use ethereal forest light. Roses use candlelight. This creates visual sub-consistency within the broader dark style.\n- **LoRA recommendation**: The **Fantasy Card Diffusion** model on HuggingFace (trained on ~35,000 MTG card artworks) provides an excellent starting point for dark fantasy card illustration.\n\n---\n\n## Production pipeline: from testing to automation\n\n### Phase 1 — Manual testing on OpenArt.ai\n\nStart with OpenArt's Essential plan ($7/month). Use **FLUX Dev** for maximum control (CFG slider, steps, seed). Upload a style reference image using Image Guidance. Test each template set by generating one card of each type (König, Ober, Under, pip, ace) across all four suits. Use the **Prompt Optimizer** toggle to compare raw vs. enhanced prompts. Save winning seeds. Use **FLUX Kontext Pro** for character consistency testing — upload a user photo and test face preservation on court cards. OpenArt's dedicated **Playing Card Generator** page provides additional tested prompts as baselines.\n\n### Phase 2 — Workflow development in ComfyUI or Weavy.ai\n\nBuild the composite pipeline following the ArtisMysterium architecture: generate card elements (illustration, background, border) in separate lanes, then composite. Essential node packages: **WAS Node Suite** (Image Paste Crop, Create Grid Image), **ComfyUI Inspire Pack** (LoadPromptsFromFile for batch), **ComfyUI_IPAdapter_plus** (style transfer), **ComfyUI-PuLID-Flux** (face identity), **ComfyUI-TextOverlay** (card values and symbols).\n\nFor **face preservation on court cards**, the recommended modern approach chains FLUX Kontext (style/context) with PuLID (identity). The user uploads a single face photo; PuLID embeds identity features; Kontext ensures the stylized portrait matches the card deck's aesthetic. Weight/timeline controls adjust how strongly identity influences the final image.\n\nAlternatively, build the same pipeline visually in **Weavy.ai** using its Text Iterator + Array Nodes for batch processing. Weavy's advantage is parallel cloud generation (36 servers simultaneously) and built-in compositing. Its limitation is less granular parameter control than ComfyUI. The free tier (150 credits) can prototype one full deck with Flux Fast.\n\n### Phase 3 — Batch automation\n\nDefine all 36 cards in a **CSV file** with columns: `suit, rank, card_type, content_prompt, is_face_card, face_reference_path`. Write a Python script that loads the base ComfyUI workflow JSON, iterates through all 36 rows, modifies the prompt node and input image references, and queues each via the ComfyUI REST API (`POST /prompt`). Monitor completion via WebSocket. Estimated generation time: **2-5 minutes per card** with FLUX, ~30 seconds with SDXL.\n\nFor quality control, adopt the NEAR Monsters approach: build an accept/reject webapp where each generated card is reviewed before advancing. Generate **4-9 variants per card** and select the best. Budget 30-50% of total production time for post-processing refinement.\n\n### Phase 4 — Print preparation\n\nUpscale all cards to **300 DPI print resolution** using Real-ESRGAN 4× or Topaz upscaling nodes. Apply batch color correction to ensure palette consistency across all 36 cards. Overlay final card borders, suit symbols, and rank indicators in Python (PIL/Pillow) or Figma for precise alignment. Services like **MakePlayingCards.com** (no minimum order, used by Kickstarter creators) or PrinterStudio handle physical production.\n\n---\n\n## Critical findings and what to watch for\n\n**AI-generated tessellations (Style B) are the hardest to execute** — models consistently fail at mathematically perfect interlocking patterns. Plan for heavy ControlNet guidance using pre-designed geometric templates, or embrace \"Escher-inspired\" rather than \"mathematically precise Escher\" as the creative direction.\n\n**Artist name references** (Greg Rutkowski, Miyazaki) work powerfully for style direction but raise ethical and legal questions for commercial products. Consider using **style descriptions** rather than living artist names in final production prompts. \"Oil painting concept art with dramatic chiaroscuro and rich atmospheric depth\" achieves similar results to naming specific artists.\n\n**FLUX.2 does not support negative prompts** — all style enforcement must be done through positive description. FLUX.1 Dev still supports negatives via CFG guidance. For Swiss Jass production, FLUX.1 Dev with LoRA or FLUX Kontext with reference images is the recommended model path.\n\nThe **commercial market for AI card decks is proven**. AI-generated tarot decks sell for $5-$80 on Etsy (hundreds of active listings). Multiple Kickstarter campaigns have shipped AI-generated card products. Transparency about AI involvement is increasingly expected by buyers.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe three prompt template sets provide a complete, production-ready foundation for generating Swiss Jass decks across radically different aesthetics. The cartoon style is the most forgiving for AI generation — bright colors and exaggerated features mask inconsistencies. The dark fantasy style produces the most visually impressive results thanks to FLUX and SDXL's natural strength with dramatic lighting and detailed textures. The Escher geometric style demands the most human intervention but yields the most distinctive product.\n\nThe most effective production architecture combines **OpenArt.ai for rapid prototyping** (test 10-20 cards manually, identify optimal prompts and seeds), **ComfyUI for automated batch generation** (36 cards via API with Inspire Pack or Python scripting), and **Weavy.ai as an optional visual pipeline builder** when iterating on the composite workflow. Each platform serves a distinct phase of the production cycle, and the modular prompt template system ensures prompts transfer cleanly between all three.",
