  "content": "Got it — a custom deck marketplace starting with Jass. That shifts the focus significantly.\n\n**What makes someone choose your platform over existing custom card printing services** (like MakePlayingCards.com or PrintNinja)? Is it:\n\n- **The generation experience** — customers describe a theme (\"steampunk alpine animals\") and your system generates the full deck automatically?\n- **Cultural authenticity** — you're the only place serving Swiss Jass players with proper card formats and artwork styles?\n- **Price/speed** — faster or cheaper than alternatives?\n- Something else?",
