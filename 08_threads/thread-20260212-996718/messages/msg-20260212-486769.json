  "content": "A/B testing different segments is smart for marketing — but it doesn't solve the **product scope** question.\n\nHere's why it matters: your three audiences want subtly different things:\n\n- **Gift-givers** care about: fast turnaround, foolproof design tools, emotional impact (less about gameplay accuracy)\n- **Game enthusiasts** care about: card quality, proper game mechanics, durability, replayability\n- **Swiss expats** care about: cultural authenticity, traditional Jass symbols/suits, nostalgia\n\n**For v1, you can't perfectly serve all three.** You'll make trade-offs on:\n- Design complexity (simple wizard vs. deep customization)\n- Print quality/materials (cheap & cheerful vs. premium linen-finish)\n- Cultural accuracy (generic playing cards vs. authentic Jass iconography)\n\n**So: what does v1 do exceptionally well, even if it means saying \"not yet\" to some features?**\n\nIs it:\n- A simple, delightful gift-deck builder (upload 12 photos → get a deck in 2 weeks)?\n- A serious Jass deck customizer for players who know the game?\n- Something else?",
