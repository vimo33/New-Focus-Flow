  "content": "Fair — there's overlap, and the product *can* serve all three. But launching requires focus.\n\n**Which group do you think will care *most* about getting this right on the first try** — meaning they'll pay a premium, tolerate some rough edges, and give you the feedback you need to improve?\n\nMy hunch: gift-givers have the highest emotional urgency (\"I need this for Dad's 60th birthday in 3 weeks\"), but game enthusiasts care most about quality and will actually *use* the product repeatedly. Swiss expats might be smallest but most passionate niche.\n\nWhat's your instinct?",
