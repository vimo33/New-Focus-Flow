  "content": "Hold on. That's important.\n\nYou're saying you don't know if more client work is coming. The 7k this month might not repeat next month.\n\nSo the real situation is:\n- **This month:** 7k from projects that just landed (Orthoanalytics, AI specialist work)\n- **Next month:** Unknown. Maybe some follow-up work, maybe not.\n- **Baseline need:** 5k/month to survive\n\nThat's not \"sporadic\" - that's **unstable**. Big difference.\n\n**Question:** What's actually in your pipeline right now?\n- Active proposals out?\n- Conversations that could convert?\n- Repeat clients likely to come back?\n\nOr are you basically at zero pipeline and need to source new work from scratch?\n\nThis changes the priority calculation completely. If the pipeline is thin, we might need to focus 80% on filling it, not 60%.\n\nWhat's the honest state of your client pipeline right now?",
