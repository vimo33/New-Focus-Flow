  "content": "Okay, so the 7k isn't recurring - it's project-based income. Let me make sure I have this right:\n\n**Current revenue sources:**\n- AI business specialist work (is this the Weiterbildung teaching/consulting?)\n- Whiteboard room - what's this exactly?\n- Orthoanalytics - just closed for 9k (one-time or recurring?)\n\nSo the real situation is: you're doing client work that pays decently but requires constant sourcing. No retainers, no recurring contracts.\n\nAnd the portfolio is mostly exploration - trying to find which idea could become a **product or service** that generates more predictable income.\n\nAm I reading this right?",
