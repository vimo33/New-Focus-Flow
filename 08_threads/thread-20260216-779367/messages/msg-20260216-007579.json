  "content": "Yeah, I got it.\n\nSo the real picture is: you're generating income through project work, but it's unpredictable. You have to keep sourcing clients. And this whole portfolio is you testing which idea could become something **more sustainable** - a product, a platform, a service that doesn't require constant hustle.\n\nThat's a very different problem than \"execute these 19 projects.\"\n\nTwo quick questions before we go further:\n\n1. **Monthly expenses** - what do you actually need to cover each month? (I have 0 in the system, which can't be right)\n2. **Time split** - what % of your time goes to client work vs. exploring these projects right now?\n\nOnce I know that, we can figure out which 2-3 of these ideas are actually worth serious investment.",
