  "content": "**There it is.** That's the real issue.\n\nYou're getting sporadic project work because you don't have a **repeatable offering** that you can pitch consistently. You're reacting to opportunities as they come instead of proactively selling something specific.\n\nThat's priority #1. Before we validate any portfolio idea, we need to create a sellable service offering that can generate predictable income.\n\nHere's what we're building:\n\n**A productized service** - something you can pitch, price, and deliver repeatedly. Not \"I do AI stuff\" - an actual packaged offering with:\n- Clear target customer\n- Specific deliverable\n- Defined scope and timeline\n- Price point\n\n**Questions to define it:**\n\n1. **What have you already done that clients paid for?** (AI training, consulting, implementation - be specific about recent wins)\n2. **What can you deliver in 2-4 weeks?** (scope needs to be tight enough to price and sell)\n3. **Who needs this right now?** (Swiss SMEs? Corporates? Specific industry?)\n4. **What would they pay?** (ballpark - we'll refine)\n\nLet's start with #1 - walk me through the Orthoanalytics project and the AI specialist work. What exactly did you deliver, and what problem did it solve for them?\n\nOnce I understand that, we'll package it into an offering you can sell next week.\n\n⚠️ 📝 Edit: `~/.openclaw/workspace/memory/2026-02-16.md` failed: File not found: [REDACTED_PATH]",
