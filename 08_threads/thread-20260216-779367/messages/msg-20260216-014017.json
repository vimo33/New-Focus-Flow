  "content": "...exactly. The portfolio is what you're exploring **right now**, not a closed list. New opportunities will emerge, some of these will die, others might combine.\n\nSo here's what I'm hearing:\n\n**Reality check:**\n- Income: ~7k/month from project work (AI consulting, Orthoanalytics type engagements)\n- Portfolio: 19 explorations - some with friends, some solo, most not revenue yet\n- Strategy: Use Nitara to figure out which bets are worth commercializing\n\n**The actual question:** \n\nGiven that setup, what should we be optimizing for right now?\n\n- Finding more client projects like the ones that are paying? (faster path to predictable income)\n- Validating one of the portfolio ideas toward product/market fit?\n- Both - but with clear priorities?\n\nWhat's your instinct?",
