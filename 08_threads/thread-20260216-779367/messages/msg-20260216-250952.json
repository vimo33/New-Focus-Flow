  "content": "Okay. **That's** the real problem.\n\nYou made 7k this month from work that landed, but you don't have a **repeatable offering** you can pitch to the next client. So each project requires custom scoping, custom pricing, custom everything - which makes it exhausting to source and inconsistent to deliver.\n\nThat's the gap we need to close **first**. Before we talk about which portfolio idea to validate, you need a productized service you can sell repeatedly.\n\nLet's build one right now based on what's already worked:\n\n**What generated that 7k?**\n- Was it AI implementation for a specific type of company?\n- Training/workshops on AI tools?\n- Strategy consulting?\n- Technical build work?\n\nTell me exactly what you delivered for Orthoanalytics and the AI specialist gig. We'll reverse-engineer that into a packaged offering you can pitch 10 more times.",
