  "content": "Alright. Mix of both. That's realistic, but it means we need to be **ruthlessly clear** about priorities and time allocation.\n\nHere's how I'd structure it:\n\n**Track 1: Stabilize the base (client work → retainers)**\n- Which of your recent clients (Weiterbildung, Orthoanalytics, others) could become recurring relationships?\n- What would that retainer look like? (Monthly support? Training programs? Advisory?)\n- Target: Get 1-2 retainers at 2-3k CHF/month within next 2-3 months\n\n**Track 2: Validate a portfolio bet**\n- Out of those 19 projects, which 1-2 are:\n  - Closest to revenue?\n  - Require the least capital to test?\n  - Align with your existing client relationships or network?\n- Pick ONE to validate this quarter. Sprint it hard.\n\n**Time split suggestion:**\n- 60% client work (keep the lights on + convert to retainers)\n- 30% portfolio validation (one focused bet)\n- 10% everything else (exploration, maintenance)\n\n**Questions:**\n\n1. **Client retainers:** Which of your recent engagements felt like they could use ongoing support?\n2. **Portfolio pick:** If you had to bet on ONE idea from the 19 to monetize in the next 90 days, which would it be?\n\nLet's start there.",
