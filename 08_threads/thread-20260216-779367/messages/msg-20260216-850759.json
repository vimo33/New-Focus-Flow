Only the commercial bets? Only the ones where you're the primary decision-maker? \n\nBecause right now it's got everything mixed together - serious ventures next to collaborative experiments next to home projects. And that makes it hard to get signal from the noise when we're trying to answer \"what should I work on this week?\"\n\nAm I tracking with you?",
