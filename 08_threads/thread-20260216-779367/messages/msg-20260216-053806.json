  "content": "Okay. So 5k CHF/month is baseline survival in Zurich.\n\nRight now you're at 7k from project work, which gives you 2k margin. That's not bad, but it's also not comfortable - especially if the work is unpredictable.\n\nSo here's the strategic question:\n\n**Do you need to stabilize income first** (find more client projects, build a retainer or two) **before** you can afford to seriously invest time in the portfolio ideas?\n\nOr do you have enough runway and confidence in the client pipeline that you can split focus - keep sourcing projects **and** validate 1-2 portfolio bets in parallel?\n\nWhat does your gut say?",
