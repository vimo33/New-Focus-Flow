  "content": "## Kavach AI: Edge-First Factory Safety Monitoring\n\n**Core Concept:**\nTurn existing CCTV cameras in Indian factories into real-time safety intelligence—detecting PPE violations, unauthorized entry, unsafe acts—with on-premises edge boxes running AI analytics. Deploy in ≤7 days via template-led onboarding. Target: mid-market manufacturing (Bangalore/Chennai), 10–60 cameras, 200–2,000 workers.\n\n**Business Model:**\n- ₹2.5k–6k/camera/year + ₹50k–1.5L site platform fee = ₹6–18L ACV (20-camera plant)\n- Hardware: lease (24–36 months) or customer-owned\n- GTM: free 30-min readiness assessment → paid pilot (₹1–3L, credited) → annual subscription\n\n**Tech Stack:**\nEdge appliances (NVIDIA L4 GPUs), ONVIF/RTSP for camera connectivity, foundation models + site calibration + selective fine-tuning (not bespoke training per site).\n\n---\n\n## Council Assessment: 5.4/10 — \"Needs Info\" (fixable gaps, not rejected)\n\n**What's Strong:**\n- Edge-first architecture is right for India (bandwidth, privacy, reliability)\n- Competitive research is solid (Visionify, Intenseye pricing validated)\n- Business model is now complete (was a gap, you closed it)\n- Conservative Phase 1 rollout (4 installs, assisted setup) manages early risk\n\n**Three Critical Blockers Before Launch:**\n\n### 1. **Legal Compliance Gap (scored 4/10)**\nYou have **zero worker consent mechanism** despite DPDP Rules 2025 requiring explicit consent for sensitive personal data (continuous video of identifiable workers qualifies). Anonymization is deferred to \"Phase 2 UX polish\"—it should be core MVP. No transparency protocol: no worker notification, no DSAR process, no appeals for disputed violations. Liability allocation (plant vs. vendor) completely unaddressed.\n\n**Risk:** DPDP penalties (₹250 crore max), union-driven installation refusals, reputational damage in labor-sensitive markets.\n\n**Fix:** Engage data privacy counsel NOW. Design worker consent mechanism, move anonymization to MVP, draft vendor-plant liability split, create transparency protocol. This is non-negotiable.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Hardware Economics Fragility (scored 5/10)**\nNVIDIA L4 GPUs cost $3–5k each; edge appliances cost $5–18k to build. Lease revenue ($5–8k/year for 20-cam site) requires **24+ months retention just to recover COGS** before accounting for failures or support. 85% retention assumption is aggressive for a new product; 15% churn = direct hardware loss.\n\nThe \"starter kit\" at ₹3–5k is economically incoherent—it can't include edge hardware at that price. Camera capacity claims (16/32/50 per tier) are likely optimistic by 30–50% in real conditions (variable FPS, multi-model overhead), forcing expensive tier upgrades.\n\n**Risk:** Unit economics collapse if churn hits 15%, or if capacity overestimation forces refunds/upgrades.\n\n**Fix:** Model economics under stress (70% retention, 30–50% lower camera capacity, ₹10–30k per-site support visits). Either fix the math or pivot to customer-owned hardware + software-only SaaS.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Deployment Reality Gap (scored 6/10)**\nONVIF \"compliance\" in practice is fragmented—legacy cameras and proprietary NVRs have buggy implementations or locked RTSP access. Your 30-min readiness assessment is a **sales tool, not a deployment gate**—it will likely reveal 30–50% of cameras need upgrades/repositioning, breaking your ROI promise.\n\n7-day deployment SLA is incompatible with typical IT approval cycles (firewall rules, VLAN policies take weeks in regulated OT environments). No remote diagnostic tooling for self-serve transition. IT/OT gatekeeper resistance acknowledged but not mitigated—no strategy for approval workflows.\n\n**Risk:** \"Works with existing CCTV\" value prop collapses when readiness assessments reveal expensive camera upgrades. SLA promise becomes reputational liability.\n\n**Fix:** Run 2–3 pre-pilots with friendly integrators in Bangalore. Measure actual ONVIF-ready %, time to live system, IT friction points, upgrade rate. Revise SLA and pricing to account for reality.\n\n---\n\n## Material Execution Risks (validate before scale):\n\n**4. CV Performance Conditional (scored 6/10):** Your 95% precision target applies only to \"green-ready\" cameras. Public Western datasets (SHWD, Kaggle) create domain gap for Indian PPE variations. Risk that \"selective fine-tuning\" becomes \"always fine-tuning.\"\n\n**5. Sales Optimism (scored 6/10):** Conversion assumptions (25–40% assessment→pilot, 50–70% pilot→annual) are **1.5–2x industry benchmarks** without India manufacturing validation. EHS champion lacks budget authority. Integrator channel conflict unresolved (why would CCTV resellers promote a solution competing with their camera upsell?).\n\n---\n\n## Bottom Line\n\nThe concept is substantive and you've iterated well (business model matured significantly). Core problems are **fixable with targeted work**, not fundamental redesign. But launching without addressing worker consent/privacy, validating hardware economics, and stress-testing deployment assumptions would be reckless.\n\n**The 7-day SLA and \"works with existing cameras\" are your strongest GTM wedges, but both rest on unvalidated assumptions that could blow up on contact with reality.**\n\nWhat do you want to tackle first—the legal blocker, the hardware math, or the deployment validation?",
