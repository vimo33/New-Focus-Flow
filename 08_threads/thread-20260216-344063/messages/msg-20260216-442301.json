  "content": "**Kavach AI (KavachVision)** — Here's what you're working with:\n\n## The Core Idea\n\nTurn existing factory CCTV into an always-on AI safety officer. Edge-first platform that detects PPE violations (helmets, vests, goggles), unauthorized entry, and unsafe acts in real-time. Target: mid-sized Indian manufacturing plants (Bangalore/Chennai) with 10-60 cameras already installed.\n\n**Key differentiation:** 30-minute camera readiness assessment → 7-day deployment (vs. competitors like Intenseye at 2+ months).\n\n---\n\n## Business Model\n\n- **Pricing:** ₹2,500-6,000/cam/year + ₹50k-1.5L platform fee\n- **20-camera plant ACV:** ₹6-18 lakh/year ($12-25k)\n- **Sales funnel:** Free assessment → Paid pilot (₹1-3L, credited to annual) → Subscription\n- **Hardware:** NVIDIA L4 GPU edge boxes (lease, buy, or customer-owned)\n\n---\n\n## Council Verdict: **5.4/10 — NEEDS INFO**\n\nThe AI Council evaluated it across 5 dimensions. **Three critical blockers before launch:**\n\n### 🔴 **1. Legal Compliance Gap (Score: 4/10)**\n- **NO worker consent mechanism** despite DPDP Rules 2025 requiring it for continuous video monitoring\n- Anonymization deferred to \"Phase 2\" when it should be **MVP core requirement**\n- Zero transparency protocol (no worker notification, no DSAR process, no appeals)\n- **Liability undefined:** Who's responsible if AI misses a violation and someone gets hurt?\n\n**Council verdict:** *\"This isn't a risk to manage—it's a legal blocker that could halt deployments or trigger regulatory action.\"*\n\n### 🟡 **2. Hardware Economics Fragility (Score: 5/10)**\n- Edge boxes cost **$5-18k to build** (NVIDIA L4 GPUs alone are $3-5k)\n- Lease revenue: only $5-8k/year → **24+ months just to recover COGS**\n- 85% retention assumption aggressive; **15% churn = unrecovered hardware losses**\n- Camera capacity claims (16/32/50 per tier) likely **30-50% optimistic** in real conditions\n- **Starter kit at ₹3-5k is economically incoherent** — can't include edge hardware at that price\n\n### 🟡 **3. Deployment Reality Gap (Score: 6/10)**\n- ONVIF \"compliance\" in practice is **fragmented** — many legacy cameras have buggy implementations\n- 30-min readiness assessment will likely reveal **30-50% of cameras need upgrades/repositioning** (breaks ROI promise)\n- **7-day deployment SLA incompatible** with typical IT approval cycles in factories (6-12 months is normal)\n- No remote diagnostic tooling for self-serve transition\n- IT gatekeepers have veto power with no strategy to navigate approval workflows\n\n---\n\n## What's Strong\n\n✅ **Technical architecture** — Edge-first, ONVIF/RTSP, foundation→calibration→fine-tuning approach is sound  \n✅ **Competitive research** — You have actual competitor pricing (Visionify, Intenseye) and realistic benchmarks  \n✅ **30-min assessment wedge** — Strongest GTM asset (concrete proof vs. \"trust me\" AI pitch)  \n✅ **Conservative Phase 1** — 4 installs, assisted setup manages early risk\n\n---\n\n## The Bottom Line\n\n**Solid technical thinking. Real market opportunity. But three structural gaps that could kill it:**\n\n1. **Launch without DPDP compliance → regulatory/legal exposure**\n2. **Hardware economics don't close → margin death spiral**\n3. **Deployment assumptions untested → broken SLA = lost credibility**\n\nThe council's recommendation: **Fix the legal blocker immediately. Stress-test hardware economics. Run real-world deployment pilots with integrators before claiming 7-day SLA.**\n\n---\n\nWant me to pull up the council's specific next steps, or dive into one of the risk areas?",
