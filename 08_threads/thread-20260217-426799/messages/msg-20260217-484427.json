  "content": "Let me read the PRD.\n\nRead it. Strong technical vision, honest about the gaps. Let's talk about the path to revenue.\n\n## What Works\n\n**Technical differentiation is real.** Full-duplex generative dialogue + spatial audio + on-device privacy is a genuine moat. Google Lens doesn't do this. Museum guides don't do this. You're not competing on features — you're competing on *experience architecture*.\n\n**You've identified the wedge.** Proactive, ambient, conversational history. That's a clear positioning vs. \"scan a QR code and read a paragraph.\"\n\n**Financial modeling is honest.** You're not pretending Year 1 is profitable. CHF -22K loss for a pilot with path to break-even Month 11 is reasonable *if* the assumptions hold.\n\n## What's Uncertain\n\n**Three assumptions carry the entire business model:**\n\n1. **15% free-to-pro conversion** — Tourism apps average 2-5%. You need 3x industry baseline. Why would this convert higher?\n\n2. **Hotel B2B at CHF 200/month** — Have you talked to *one* hotel? What's their budget for guest experience tools? Who signs this contract — front desk, marketing, GM?\n\n3. **Zürich Tourismus partnership** — What happens if they say no? You've positioned this as critical distribution, but Launch happens Month 6 regardless. Which is it?\n\n## The Revenue Question\n\nYou're asking \"should I build this?\" I'd reframe: **\"What's the cheapest way to validate willingness to pay?\"**\n\nBuilding the full MVP (Months 1-6, CHF 15K, 3 months full-time) assumes the answer is yes. That's expensive validation.\n\n**Cheaper validation path:**\n\n**Week 1-2: Fake Door Test**\n- Landing page: \"Mirari — History Speaks to You in Zurich\"\n- Video mockup: Someone walking Bahnhofstrasse, spatial audio demo, character dialogue sample\n- CTA: \"Join the beta waitlist — CHF 4.99/month when we launch\"\n- Drive 500 people to it (Zürich expat groups, travel subreddits, tourism Instagram ads)\n- **Success metric:** 10% email capture, 30% of emails say \"yes, I'd pay\" in follow-up survey\n\n**Cost:** CHF 2K (video production, landing page, ads). **Time:** 2 weeks.\n\nIf that *doesn't* work, you just saved CHF 13K and 10 weeks.\n\n**Week 3: Hotel Calls**\n- Identify 10 Zurich hotels (4-star+, target business/tourist mix)\n- Cold email guest experience managers with the landing page\n- Pitch: \"We're building AI historical companion. Would you pay CHF 200/month to include this in guest welcome packages?\"\n- **Success metric:** 2/10 take a meeting, 1/10 says \"if you build it, we'd pilot\"\n\nIf *zero* hotels respond, your B2B revenue line is speculative.\n\n**Week 4: Zürich Tourismus**\n- You already have the landing page + hotel interest (or lack thereof)\n- Approach with: \"We're validating demand. Here's early traction. Would you consider official partnership if we hit 1K users?\"\n- **Success metric:** They take the meeting and give you clear criteria for partnership\n\n## The Build Decision\n\nIf after 4 weeks you have:\n- ✅ 10%+ landing page conversion with payment intent\n- ✅ 1 hotel LOI or serious pilot interest\n- ✅ Zürich Tourismus says \"prove 1K users, we'll talk\"\n\n**Then** proceed to MVP. You've de-risked distribution and monetization.\n\nIf you have *none* of those:\n- The tech is cool\n- The market doesn't care at the price point you need\n\n## My Lean\n\n**This is a \"prove demand first, build second\" project.** The technical complexity (spatial audio, on-device AI, generative characters) makes the build expensive. The revenue model (freemium + B2B) has two unvalidated assumptions stacked on top of each other.\n\nYou're a technical founder. Your instinct is to build. I'd challenge: **can you validate this without writing code?**\n\nThe founder note to Council says *\"I'm most uncertain about the hotel B2B model and whether tourists will pay.\"* You've named the exact risks. Now test them before betting 3 months.\n\nWant me to draft the landing page copy and hotel outreach script?",
