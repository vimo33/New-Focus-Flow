# Network Enrichment Report
**Date:** 2026-02-19
**Analyst:** Nitara Network Intelligence
**Contacts Analyzed:** 94 (highest-priority subset of 1,801 total)
**Contacts Deep-Enriched:** 20
**Confidence:** 72%

---

## Executive Summary

The network contains 1,801 contacts from a LinkedIn export plus Google Contacts import. The vast majority (roughly 1,700) are dormant connections from 2012-2020 with no strategic signal. The active and recoverable layer consists of 94 contacts from 2024-2025 — this is where all revenue opportunity lives.

Three patterns stand out immediately:

1. **A Zürich AI founder cluster from early 2025.** Four AI founders were contacted in rapid succession (Jan-Apr 2025): Dan-George Filimon (Amulet AI), Julie Rielle (MindHeal AG), Jan Fülscher (Cognel), Penny Schiffer (Raized.ai). Vimo was clearly embedded in the Zürich AI founder community during that period. This cluster needs reactivation as a group — not as four separate outreach threads.

2. **An ESG cluster with a single high-leverage node.** Rodolphe Bocquet (ESG4Boards) is 20+ years of ESG infrastructure experience wrapped in one warm connection. He is the network's most strategically powerful ESG contact and the fastest path to validating Bramha ESG's thesis. One conversation with him is worth more than 20 cold calls to Swiss SME compliance managers.

3. **One contact that directly solves an active task.** Tommy Fliski (Green Marmot Capsule Hotel) is the answer to Vimo's most critical active validation task: securing a hotel partner for AURA's QR card pilot. This is not a future opportunity — it is a blocked task with a warm contact who can unblock it today.

## PASS 2 — Top 20 Deep Enrichment

### Tier 1: Act This Week

---

#### 1. Dan-George Filimon — Amulet AI
**Score:** 7.8 | **Last contact:** 20 Feb 2025 | **Project:** Multiplium

Former Google Staff Engineer (YouTube Ads, Search Ads). Founded Amulet AI AG in Zürich, April 2024. Building on-device LLMs for psychological narrative analysis. Flagship: Qybala v1, a tarot-inspired self-reflection app. Pre-seed stage. Also pursuing MSc in Psychology & Neuroscience at King's College London.

**Why this matters:** Vimo and Dan-George are building in the same city, in the same technology layer, at the same funding stage. A coffee conversation could yield a co-builder relationship, a mutual referral, or a Multiplium beta customer. The connection is 12 months stale — not yet cold.

**Suggested action:** Send a LinkedIn message this week. "Dan-George — we connected last February in the Zürich AI scene. I have been building Multiplium, an AI orchestration layer for multi-agent pipelines. Given Amulet AI's work on on-device LLMs, I think there's an interesting overlap in how we're thinking about model orchestration. Coffee this week or next?" One paragraph. No pitch deck. Propose a physical meeting.

---

#### 2. Penny Schiffer — Raized.ai
**Score:** 7.8 | **Last contact:** 08 Apr 2025 | **Project:** ATX

CEO and co-founder of Raized.ai, a Swiss startup using AI and data analytics to make early-stage VC investing smarter. Backed by SICTIC, Swissnex, Kickstart Accelerator, and BlueLion Incubator. Featured by Venturelab for exploring Asian firms' appetite for data-driven deal sourcing. Total funding: $243K pre-seed.

**Why this matters:** ATX (Agentic Trust Exchange) is an AI-mediated professional compatibility matching network. Raized.ai is a data-driven investor-startup matching network. These are conceptually the same product applied to different relationships — there is an obvious product and business model conversation to be had. Additionally, Penny has navigated Swiss startup funding programs (SICTIC, Kickstart) that Vimo has not yet accessed.

**Suggested action:** Send a LinkedIn message referencing the Venturelab article about Raized.ai. "Penny — I saw the Venturelab piece on Raized.ai and the Asian VC angle. I am building ATX (Agentic Trust Exchange), an AI-mediated professional collaboration network that evaluates compatibility between collaborators before they commit time. The conceptual overlap with your deal sourcing work is striking. Would love 20 minutes to compare notes — and potentially explore whether there is a partnership angle. Are you in Zürich? Happy to meet for coffee." Timeline: this week.

---

#### 3. Jan Fülscher — Cognel
**Score:** 7.8 | **Last contact:** 16 Apr 2025 | **Project:** Multiplium

Co-founder of Cognel.ai (systematic and reliable AI reasoning, team of 5). Also CEO of senozon (data analytics and location decisions, 20+ years). Serial founder, investor, and assistant lecturer at University of Zurich and Bern. Connected to Impact Hub Zürich and Top 100 Swiss Startups ecosystem.

**Why this matters:** Jan has three things Vimo needs: (1) 20+ years of Swiss startup experience, (2) investor relationships, (3) an active AI company that may benefit from Multiplium infrastructure. As an assistant lecturer, he also has institutional connections that could open doors for Bramha ESG pilots with universities.

**Suggested action:** LinkedIn message this week. "Jan — I think it's been about 10 months since we connected. I have been building Multiplium, an AI orchestration layer, and I am curious about how you are approaching the reasoning reliability problem at Cognel. Would you be up for a coffee in Zürich this month? Happy to share what I am working on in return." Simple. Specific. Let the conversation do the work.

---

#### 4. Rodolphe Bocquet — ESG4Boards
**Score:** 7.2 | **Last contact:** 04 Sep 2025 | **Project:** Bramha ESG

20+ years in sustainable finance: London Stock Exchange, Stoxx, Swiss Re, Beyond Ratings, Clarity AI (VP Partnerships & Regulation), Qontigo (Global Head of ESG). Contributing member at ESG4Boards — governance-level ESG for corporate boards. Speaker at Building Bridges (Geneva) and Responsible Investor Europe.

**Why this matters:** Rodolphe is the single most credentialed ESG contact in the network. He has been in every major ESG institution in Europe. He understands what boards actually struggle with in ESG reporting — and that is exactly the insight Bramha ESG needs before writing a line of code. One 30-minute conversation with him could validate or kill the Bramha ESG thesis.

**Suggested action:** LinkedIn message referencing their September 2025 conversation. "Rodolphe — great connecting in September. I have been developing Bramha ESG since then — an AI-native ESG compliance platform specifically for Swiss SMEs. Before I go deep on the product, I would love 30 minutes of your time to pressure-test the thesis: what do you see as the real pain point for Swiss SME boards in ESG reporting? Your perspective on this would be invaluable." Frame as research. No ask for business. Timeline: this week.

---

#### 5. Jitender Singh Dahiya — KroniQ AI
**Score:** 7.3 | **Last contact:** 23 May 2024 | **Project:** Multiplium

Founder and CEO of KroniQ AI. 18+ years in banking before pivoting to AI entrepreneurship. KroniQ AI achieved 500+ users in 5 days of launch — strong early product-market signal. Active builder-in-public on LinkedIn. Focused on AI tools for productivity and knowledge management.

**Why this matters:** Jitender is a peer solo founder building AI tools with demonstrated early traction. His user base could be a distribution channel for Nitara or a Multiplium integration. The conversation is low-risk and high-value — peer exchange, not a pitch.

**Suggested action:** Comment on his most recent LinkedIn post this week, then send a direct message. "Jitender — your 500 users in 5 days post stuck with me. That is a real signal. I am building Multiplium, an AI orchestration layer for multi-agent pipelines, and separately Nitara, an AI business partner for founders. Would love to swap notes on what is and is not working in AI tools. Are you open to a 20-minute call?" Timeline: this week.

---

#### 6. Tommy Fliski — Green Marmot Capsule Hotel
**Score:** 6.0 | **Last contact:** 11 Nov 2024 | **Project:** Mirari / AURA

BD Manager at Green Marmot Capsule Hotel, Zürich. Swedish-Swiss background. Controls hotel partnership and in-property promotion decisions for a boutique capsule hotel that attracts exactly the tech-savvy independent traveler that AURA targets.

**Why this matters:** This is not a strategic conversation — it is an operational unlock. Vimo's most critical current task is: "Secure one boutique hotel commitment for QR card distribution as a pre-build validation requirement." Tommy can say yes or no to this in one message. The cost to Green Marmot is zero. The benefit is that AURA guests get a free, premium Zürich experience. This is a win-win that should be completed in 48 hours.

**Suggested action:** Contact Tommy by the end of this week via LinkedIn or email. "Tommy — I am building AURA, a voice AI companion that brings Zürich's history to life for hotel guests. We are piloting with 3 boutique Zürich hotels — placing QR cards at reception or in key card envelopes. Zero cost to the hotel, and guests get a free premium city experience. Would Green Marmot be open to a 10-minute chat about a pilot this month?" This directly completes a critical active validation task.

---

#### 7. Kevin Sartori — Nivek (Deep Tech Advisor)
**Score:** 6.8 | **Last contact:** 22 Apr 2025 | **Project:** Kavach AI

Growth advisor specializing in scaling deep tech ventures in Switzerland. Based in Switzerland, focused on early-stage to scale-up transition for technical founders.

**Suggested action:** LinkedIn message referencing the April 2025 conversation. "Kevin — checking back in after our April conversation. I have advanced significantly on Kavach AI (edge-AI security monitoring) and Multiplium (AI orchestration). Would love a quick call to share updates and explore whether there is an advisory fit for either project. Are you available for 20 minutes in March?" Timeline: this week.

---

#### 8. Ajith Govind Satheesh — Cactus
**Score:** 6.3 | **Last contact:** 26 Aug 2025 | **Project:** Kavach AI

Co-Founder & CEO of Cactus. Most recently contacted founder in the active network (6 months ago). Relationship is warm enough for a direct ask.

**Suggested action:** Brief LinkedIn message this week. "Ajith — checking in after our August conversation. Big progress on Kavach AI since then. Would love to catch up — and I am also looking for one or two introductions in the Indian enterprise security or smart cities space. If anyone comes to mind, I would greatly appreciate it. Happy to make introductions in return." One specific ask. Low friction.

**Suggested action:** Contact Johannes via LinkedIn by end of next week. "Johannes — I have been following Climate Week Zürich's growth.

**Suggested action:** LinkedIn message this month referencing the AX launch. "Denis — I saw the AX announcement — bold move into the AI accelerator space. I have been building Overture, a community-driven live music performance platform. It feels like a natural creative tech play. Would Overture be a candidate for AX's first cohort? Happy to share the brief." Short. Direct. Let him evaluate.

---

#### 11. Mariella Reffo — Inventsys AG
**Score:** 6.8 | **Last contact:** 14 Mar 2025 | **Project:** Bramha ESG

CEO of Inventsys AG (Zürich SaaS for municipal infrastructure management). Recently received a non-diluting UBS growth loan — scale-up phase. Background in M&A, banking strategy, and Antler alumni. Selling SaaS to Swiss municipalities and public sector.

**Suggested action:** LinkedIn message this month. "Mariella — congrats on the UBS growth milestone — that's a real validation of the model. I am building Bramha ESG, an AI-native compliance platform for Swiss SMEs, and I am learning a lot about selling SaaS into Swiss public sector as I design the GTM. Would you be open to 20 minutes to share your experience? Happy to exchange notes." Frame as learning, not pitch.

**Suggested action:** LinkedIn message this month. "Alexander — following up on our connection. Futurae's Series A and international expansion trajectory is impressive. I have been building Kavach AI, an edge-AI physical security monitoring platform. I think there's an interesting complementary angle between Futurae's digital authentication layer and Kavach's physical security monitoring — both protecting the same enterprise clients. Would you be open to a 20-minute exploratory call?" Timeline: this month.

---

**Score:** 5.8 | **Last contact:** 19 Nov 2024 | **Project:** Bramha ESG

Outbound Sales Lead at ecoinvent (Zürich), the world's leading LCA database. ecoinvent v3.12 was released November 2025 with expanded sector coverage.

**Suggested action:** LinkedIn message this month. "Armin — I saw the v3.12 release and the expanded sector coverage. I am building Bramha ESG, an AI-native ESG compliance platform for Swiss SMEs, and I am evaluating which emissions factor datasets to integrate as the backbone. ecoinvent is the obvious first choice. Would you be open to discussing a data partnership or licensing arrangement?" This is a natural outbound sales conversation from his side too — he will likely be receptive.

---

**Score:** 5.5 | **Last contact:** 13 Nov 2024 | **Project:** Kavach AI

Direct ask for a pilot conversation — appropriate for an open innovation manager.

**Suggested action:** LinkedIn message this month. "Thomas — following up from our November connection. I have been building Mirari, a spatial AR companion for Zürich that overlays historical context on the physical environment using voice-first AI. Given the spatial computing / positioning technology angle, I am curious whether this could be relevant for ESA BIC consideration, or whether there are ETH research groups working in adjacent areas. Would you be open to a quick conversation?" Frame as exploration, not application.

---

**Score:** 5.8 | **Last contact:** 24 Dec 2024 | **Project:** Kavach AI

**Score:** 5.8 | **Last contact:** 27 Feb 2025 | **Project:** Bramha ESG

Project Manager at Venturelab, the central Swiss startup support institution. Swiss startups surpassed CHF 2.4B in 2026 — Venturelab is at the center of that capital flow.

I have made significant progress on two projects: Bramha ESG (AI-native ESG compliance for Swiss SMEs) and Mirari (a voice AI companion for Zürich).

#### 20. Asha Jomis — Governance Innovation Labs
**Score:** 5.5 | **Last contact:** 10 Nov 2024 | **Project:** Global Foundation for Transparent Collective Gatherings

"Asha — I have been developing the Global Foundation for Transparent Collective Gatherings, a governance institution for large events and collective decision-making. Your expertise in public policy and governance innovation would be incredibly valuable as we design the policy framework. Would you be open to a 30-minute advisory conversation?"

## PASS 3 — Network Gap Analysis

### Missing: Swiss VC / Angel Investors
**Gap severity: Critical.** The network has zero active Swiss angel investors or seed-stage VCs. Penny Schiffer (Raized.ai) navigated SICTIC and Kickstart — she can make warm introductions. Jan Fülscher is also an angel — direct ask after a coffee meeting.

### Missing: Hotel / Tourism Distribution (beyond one contact)
**Gap severity: High for AURA/Mirari.** Only one hotel contact exists. Need 3-5 boutique Zürich hotel BD contacts and one Zürich Tourism relationship. This is solvable in 30 days with direct outreach.

### Missing: Swiss Regulatory / Compliance Officials
**Gap severity: High for Bramha ESG.** No FINMA, BAFU, or cantonal regulatory contacts. Rodolphe Bocquet (ESG4Boards) is the fastest path into these circles via introduction.

### Missing: Enterprise Corporate Decision-Makers
**Gap severity: Medium.** No contacts at Swiss large corporates (ABB, Roche, Nestlé, Novartis) for enterprise pilots. HITS (Generali) is the current best path into this layer.

### Missing: Singapore Network
**Gap severity: Medium for ATX, Kavach AI.** Only Ashwin Gangappa (NUS) touches Singapore. Need SGInnovate, Enterprise Singapore, and startup ecosystem contacts to execute on Singapore market entry for ATX.

### Missing: India Enterprise Network (for Kavach AI)
**Gap severity: Medium.** Most India connections are dormant from 2012-2018. Ajith Govind Satheesh (Aug 2025) is the best active India-connected contact — leverage for warm introductions to Indian enterprise/smart cities decision-makers.
