## Revenue-Adjacent Opportunities

### This Week

**Tommy Fliski / Green Marmot Capsule Hotel** — AURA hotel distribution pilot
The single most operationally urgent contact in the network. Vimo's active task list includes "secure one boutique hotel commitment for QR card distribution." Tommy is the BD Manager at a Zürich capsule hotel serving tech-savvy independent travelers. Contact in 48 hours with a zero-cost partnership proposal.

**Rodolphe Bocquet / ESG4Boards** — Bramha ESG thesis validation
20+ year ESG expert, former Global Head of ESG at Qontigo, former VP Partnerships at Clarity AI. Last contacted September 2025. A single 30-minute research conversation with him validates or kills Bramha ESG before significant development investment. Frame as market research, not pitch.

**Penny Schiffer / Raized.ai** — ATX partnership + SICTIC introduction
AI-powered VC deal sourcing platform backed by SICTIC and Kickstart. Conceptual overlap with ATX's agent-based compatibility matching. Ask for SICTIC angel introduction after the ATX conversation — this unlocks 200+ Swiss angels simultaneously.

**Dan-George Filimon / Amulet AI** — Multiplium peer + Zürich AI network reactivation
Ex-Google Staff Engineer building on-device LLMs in Zürich (Amulet AI AG). Pre-seed stage. Contact for an in-person coffee meeting to reactivate the 2025 Zürich AI founder cluster.

**Jan Fülscher / Cognel** — Multiplium peer + potential investor
Serial Swiss founder-investor at intersection of AI and systematic reasoning. Coffee meeting in Zürich. Potential advisor, angel investor, or Multiplium beta customer.

**Nathalie Manetti / Venturelab** — Swiss VC pipeline access
Central Swiss startup institution. Swiss startups surpassed CHF 2.4B in 2026 funding. One conversation unlocks program applications and VC introductions. Relationship 12 months stale — reactivate now.

### This Month

**Denis Belkevich / Fuelarts** — Overture + AX accelerator
Just launched AX (AI-powered creative tech accelerator). Overture is a natural candidate for AX's first cohort. Direct ask with a short brief.

**Mathias Vazquez Rodriguez / HITS (Generali)** — Kavach AI enterprise pilot
Open Innovation Manager at Generali's Zürich insurtech hub with 20 active AI-first startups. Kavach AI's workplace safety monitoring reduces insurance claims — natural Generali pilot value proposition.

**Armin Agic / ecoinvent** — Bramha ESG data partnership
Outbound Sales Lead at ecoinvent (v3.12 released November 2025). Data licensing partnership would give Bramha ESG instant credibility on scope 3 emissions reporting.

## Introduction Chains

**Rodolphe Bocquet → Swiss ESG regulatory circles:** After the Bramha ESG validation conversation, request one introduction to a Swiss compliance or regulatory contact (FINMA-adjacent, cantonal ESG body, or Big 4 ESG practice). This is one hop away from regulatory design partners.

**Penny Schiffer → SICTIC angels:** After the ATX conversation, request a warm introduction to SICTIC. This is one introduction away from 200+ Swiss angels.

**Jan Fülscher → Top 100 Swiss Startups / Impact Hub network:** After the coffee meeting, request an introduction to the Top 100 Swiss Startups program (which Jan is connected to). This is one step away from institutional startup visibility.

## Dormant Reactivations

**Ajith Govind Satheesh / Cactus (Aug 2025)** — Most recently contacted founder in the network. Light-touch reactivation this week with a direct ask for an introduction to Indian enterprise security contacts.

---

## Network Clusters

**Zürich AI Founders (2025 cluster):** Dan-George Filimon, Penny Schiffer, Jan Fülscher, Julie Rielle — all contacted in early 2025. Reactivate as a group, not individually. Signal: Vimo was embedded in this community. Goal: rebuild that embedded position.

**ESG/Sustainability Switzerland:** Rodolphe Bocquet, Johannes Pokorny, Armin Agic — concentrated ESG practitioners. Bramha ESG has a ready-made advisory and distribution network here if engaged correctly.

**Swiss Institutional Gateways:** Nathalie Manetti (Venturelab), Thomas Ackermann (ETH), Mathias Vazquez Rodriguez (HITS/Generali) — three institutions that collectively cover Swiss VC access, incubation, and corporate pilots.

## Network Gaps

| Gap | Severity | Solution Path |
|---|---|---|
| No Swiss angels / seed VC | Critical | SICTIC via Penny Schiffer; Jan Fülscher directly |
| One hotel contact for AURA | High | Direct outreach to 5 more Zürich boutique hotels |
| No ESG regulatory contacts | High | Rodolphe Bocquet introduction chain |
| Singapore network empty | Medium | Ashwin Gangappa (NUS) introduction to SGInnovate |
| India enterprise network dormant | Medium | Ajith Govind Satheesh introduction chain |
| No Swiss enterprise CSO contacts | Medium | Johannes Pokorny / Climate Week Zurich |
