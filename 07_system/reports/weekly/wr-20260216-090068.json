  "retrospective": "**Week in Review**\n\nStrong revenue performance (+$7K) contrasts sharply with zero task completions across 17 active projects, suggesting resource fragmentation and possible misalignment between billable work and project tracking. With 0% task efficiency, the portfolio is likely over-extended—consider consolidating to 5-7 high-priority projects and implementing a \"finish before starting\" discipline. Immediate action: conduct a project audit this week to identify which initiatives can be paused, delegated, or closed to restore forward momentum.",
