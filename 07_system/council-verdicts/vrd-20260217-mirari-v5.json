  "subject_description": "Zero-UI temporal companion overlaying history onto physical Zurich. Full-duplex multimodal AI using MiniCPM-o 4.5, Qwen3-VL spatial grounding, and generative world engine for unscripted historical roleplay. Voice-first, proactive landmark identification, 4-layer spatial audio, on-device privacy. Version 5.0 - Post-Freedom Design.",
  "recommendation": "needs-info",
  "executive_summary": "Mirari V5.0 is the most technically coherent and emotionally resonant project in the portfolio — a historical companion that speaks when it sees something interesting, generates personalized souvenirs of your walk, and lets you argue with Zwingli is genuinely compelling. The vision is right for 2026 and aligns with Vimo's strengths. But the submission conflates product quality with product discovery, and the financial projections assume a discovery mechanism that doesn't yet exist. Three validation gates must be cleared before build can begin: tourist WTP intercept test, hotel distribution commitment (not revenue — distribution), and architectural revision to GPS-first/cloud-conversation model. The council is not rejecting Mirari — it is saying the work to be done is in the real world, not in the product specification.",
  "key_insight": "Distribution is a launch requirement, not a growth-phase activity. Every tourist who uses Mirari will have been placed there by a hotel key card, a Zürich Tourismus recommendation, or a viral travel vlogger video — not organic App Store discovery. The submission plans hotel partnerships as revenue streams; they are actually the primary distribution channel and must be secured before build begins.",

Concern: conversion assumptions are 3-5x optimistic. Realistic cold-start conversion is 5-7% vs. 12% projected. Tourism timing window (2.3 nights average stay) creates freemium mechanic misalignment."

Simultaneous 4-model on-device stack (MiniCPM-o 4.5 + Qwen3-VL + MobileLLM-Pro P1 + NeuTTS-Nano) will cause thermal throttling within 8-10 minutes under real-world conditions, not the 15-minute target. Required fix: GPS-first trigger, cloud-conversation model, on-device only for activation — adds 3-4 weeks but solves thermal and hallucination risk simultaneously."

      "weight": 0.25,
      "reasoning": "Unit economics are actually healthy (CHF 3.04/month contribution margin at 61%). The problem is volume: at realistic 5% cold-start conversion, Year 1 revenue is CHF 21K against CHF 43K costs — a CHF 22K hole. CHF 9.99 one-time city pass deserves serious evaluation over subscription. Digital Souvenir should move from Pro add-on to free viral mechanic. iOS dev budget (CHF 18K) is 40-60% below Zürich market rate."

The business model has a solvable gap (Digital Souvenir as free tier, city pass pricing evaluation). Run the intercept test first.
