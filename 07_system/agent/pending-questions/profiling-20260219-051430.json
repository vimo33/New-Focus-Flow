  "question_text": "I want to understand where your business actually comes from. How did your current two revenue streams — the AI Course and the Explainer Video work with FTR — reach you? Did they come through a warm introduction, inbound inquiry, or did you hunt them? This tells me which channels actually work and where I should be watching for opportunities.",
  "context": "Understanding your referral sources and business development patterns is critical. It shows me which introductions are most likely to convert, which communities or channels deserve more of your time, and which opportunities I should surface to you. Right now I have your revenue but not the path that got you there.",
