  "question_text": "I want to map your work split with Savya and understand how decisions actually get made between you two. Are there projects you're leading solo, projects where Savya leads, and projects you're building together? And on revenue — is it 50/50 on everything, or does it vary by project?",
  "context": "Knowing your partnership structure directly affects how I calculate your real time allocation, revenue potential per project, and decision authority. Right now I see 'Soft Schwizz' and 'Follow the Rabbit Studios' but I don't know if Savya is a co-founder, a collaborator on specific projects, or something else entirely. That gap shapes all my portfolio and financial recommendations.",
